      The expertise, experience, and perspective of physicians and physician
      assistants practicing in Washington is crucial to helping to inform our
      advocacy on your behalf. And, it's often crucial in helping to inform
      legislators' decision-making on policy being debated at the state and
      federal levels.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this page, we'll highlight some of WSMA's top advocacy priorities where
      lawmakers need to hear from physicians and PAs directly.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>
      Reinstate Medicaid Rate Increases and Improve Patient Access to Care
    </h2>
    <p>
      The 2020 operating budget as passed by the Legislature included
      reimbursement rate increases for primary care, pediatric, and behavioral
      health care services delivered to enrollees of the state’s Medicaid
      program effective Jan. 1, 2021. Unfortunately, the appropriation was among
      the items vetoed by the governor last April in response to the pandemic
      and its impact on state revenues, negating leadership on the part of the
      many legislators who championed this issue, as well as years of advocacy
      from the WSMA and our partner stakeholders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Legislators in Olympia are now discussing and shaping the state’s next
      two-year operating budget.
      <strong
        >We need you to act: Write your state senator and representatives and
        ask them to prioritize access to health care services in the state’s
        Medicaid program by supporting reinstatement of the reimbursement rate
        adjustments adopted during the 2020 session.</strong

    <h2>Urge Support for Telemedicine, PPE Reimbursement</h2>
    <p>
      With the 2021 legislative session more than halfway complete, we are at a
      critical juncture. Two of WSMA's priority practice viability bills need a
      push from the physician community to maintain their momentum: one bill
      ensures continued access to care via audio-only telemedicine, and the
      other allows physicians to recoup personal protective equipment costs.
      Lawmakers need to hear from you today on how these bills will impact your
      practice and the patients you serve.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Audio-only telemedicine, House Bill 1196 </strong><br />
      <a
        href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=1196&amp;Initiative=false&amp;Year=2021"
        >HB 1196</a
      >
      would allow patients to receive covered health care services over the
      telephone, advancing the goal of ensuring they get the right care, in the
      right place, at the right time. Due to existing emergency orders, insurers
      are currently required to cover audio-only services, but action is needed
      to ensure patients can continue to receive appropriate care over the phone
      on an ongoing basis. HB 1196 was approved by the House on Feb. 24 by a
      vote of 94-3. The bill is now in the Senate.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>PPE reimbursement, Senate Bill 5169 </strong><br />
      <a
        href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=5169&amp;Initiative=false&amp;Year=2021"
        >SB 5169</a
      >
      would require commercial insurance carriers to reimburse for personal
      protective equipment costs that were increased because of the pandemic.
      The bill would allow physicians and health care providers to bill newly
      created CPT code 99072 and be reimbursed $6.57 per patient encounter,
      pursuant to a recommendation from the AMA’s RUC committee. SB 5169 is
      necessary to spread the increased PPE costs and ensure everyone is paying
      their fair share. SB 5169 was approved unanimously by the Senate on Feb.
      10. The bill is now in the House.

    <h2>Tell U.S. House Representative to Vote YES on H.R. 1868</h2>
    <p>
      If Congress doesn’t act by March 31, the Medicare payment sequester will
      take effect, triggering a devastating cut for physician practices across
      the country, many of which are already strained to the breaking point.
      Recently legislation was introduced in the House that would protect
      physician practices by extending the current Medicare sequester moratorium
      beyond the March 31 deadline. H.R. 1868 would give physicians a
      much-needed reprieve, so they can continue to focus on providing the best
      care for their patients without having to worry about these arbitrary cuts
      to their Medicare payments.&nbsp;<strong
        >Please contact your Representative and urge them to support America’s
        physicians by voting YES on H.R. 1868.</strong

      Urge the Office of the Insurance Commissioner to Continue Support for
      Telemedicine Payment Policies
    </h2>
    <p>
      In response to the COVID-19 public health crisis, The Washington State
      Office of the Insurance Commissioner implemented
      <a
        href="https://www.insurance.wa.gov/sites/default/files/documents/emergency-order-20-02_3.pdf"
        >Emergency Order 20-02</a
      >, requiring OIC-regulated fully insured health plans to pay at parity for
      medical services provided via telephone and requiring all state-regulated
      carriers to permit and reimburse for care provided over non-HIPAA
      compliant platforms, including video chat applications. Recently, the OIC
      extended its emergency order to April 4.
      <strong
        >Please take a moment to thank the OIC for these flexibilities and urge

    <h3>Sample message</h3>
    <p>
      My name is [Name], I am a [Physician at Location], and I write to thank
      you for the telemedicine flexibilities you have provided and urge your to
      support for the continued extension of Emergency Order 20-02 for the
      duration of the public health crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Physicians and practices need certainty that these policies will remain in
      effect as the pandemic continues to play out in Washington state so that
      there is no interruption in our ability to provide care to our patients.
    </p>
    <h3>Talking points</h3>
    <p>
      Telemedicine, including care provided over the telephone, has emerged as a
      critical tool for physicians by allowing patients to see their them
      conveniently and safely, without the need to travel and without the risk
      of exposure to, and potential spread of, the virus.
    </p>
    <p>
      OIC Emergency Order 20-02, requiring OIC-regulated fully insured health
      plans to pay at parity for telephone services and requiring all
      state-regulated carriers to permit and reimburse for care provided over
      non-HIPAA compliant platforms, including video chat applications, will
      should be extended through the duration of the public health crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s important that everyone continue chronic care management and routine
      care without disruption or delay, to ensure that patients are being
      properly managed during this time of social distancing. Telemedicine,
      including telephone, offers physician practices the ability to manage
      acute or chronic conditions unrelated to COVID-19, including certain
      primary care, pediatric care, behavioral health, and other services.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the telemedicine (audio/visual) payment parity provisions of SB 5385
      fully effective on Jan. 1, 2021, it’s still important that care provided
      over the telephone or over non-HIPAA compliant platforms continue to be at
      payment parity with in-person visits through the end of the public health
      emergency, so that there is no interruption in physicians’ ability to
      provide care to their patients.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like virtually all of our state’s businesses, physician practices have
      been financially impacted by the pandemic. Telemedicine payment parity has
      been a life raft for many of our state’s practices, helping to keep
      practices afloat and facilitating access to care for patients across the
      state. We thank the OIC for its previous emergency orders providing for
      payment parity for services provided over the telephone or non-HIPAA
      compliant platforms, and urge you to continue to extend these provisions
      until the end of the public health emergency.
