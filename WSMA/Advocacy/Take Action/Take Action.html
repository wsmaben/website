      The expertise, experience, and perspective of physicians and physician
      assistants practicing in Washington is crucial to helping to inform our
      advocacy on your behalf. And, it's often crucial in helping to inform
      legislators' decision-making on policy being debated at the state and
      federal levels.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this page, we'll highlight some of WSMA's top advocacy priorities where
      lawmakers need to hear from physicians and PAs directly.

    >
      Urge the Office of the Insurance Commissioner to Continue Support for
      Telemedicine Payment Policies
    </h2>
    <p>
      In response to the COVID-19 public health crisis, The Washington State
      Office of the Insurance Commissioner implemented
      <a
        href="https://www.insurance.wa.gov/sites/default/files/documents/emergency-order-20-02_3.pdf"
        >Emergency Order 20-02</a
      >, requiring OIC-regulated fully insured health plans to pay at parity for
      medical services provided via telephone and requiring all state-regulated
      carriers to permit and reimburse for care provided over non-HIPAA
      compliant platforms, including video chat applications. Recently, the OIC
      extended its emergency order to May 2.
      <strong
        >Please take a moment to thank the OIC for these flexibilities and urge
        them to continue to support telehealth/phone consultation at payment
        parity with in-person visits through the duration of the public health
        crisis.</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Send a message to the OIC by sending an email to
      <a href="mailto:MikeK@oic.wa.gov">MikeK@oic.wa.gov</a>. (Note: You will
      receive an automatic response that you can disregard.) We've supplied
      messaging if helpful.

    </p>
    <h3>Sample message</h3>
    <p>
      My name is [Name], I am a [Physician at Location], and I write to thank
      you for the telemedicine flexibilities you have provided and urge your to
      support for the continued extension of Emergency Order 20-02 for the
      duration of the public health crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Physicians and practices need certainty that these policies will remain in
      effect as the pandemic continues to play out in Washington state so that
      there is no interruption in our ability to provide care to our patients.
    </p>
    <h3>Talking points</h3>
    <p>
      Telemedicine, including care provided over the telephone, has emerged as a
      critical tool for physicians by allowing patients to see their them
      conveniently and safely, without the need to travel and without the risk
      of exposure to, and potential spread of, the virus.
    </p>
    <p>
      OIC Emergency Order 20-02, requiring OIC-regulated fully insured health
      plans to pay at parity for telephone services and requiring all
      state-regulated carriers to permit and reimburse for care provided over
      non-HIPAA compliant platforms, including video chat applications, will
      should be extended through the duration of the public health crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s important that everyone continue chronic care management and routine
      care without disruption or delay, to ensure that patients are being
      properly managed during this time of social distancing. Telemedicine,
      including telephone, offers physician practices the ability to manage
      acute or chronic conditions unrelated to COVID-19, including certain
      primary care, pediatric care, behavioral health, and other services.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the telemedicine (audio/visual) payment parity provisions of SB 5385
      fully effective on Jan. 1, 2021, it’s still important that care provided
      over the telephone or over non-HIPAA compliant platforms continue to be at
      payment parity with in-person visits through the end of the public health
      emergency, so that there is no interruption in physicians’ ability to
      provide care to their patients.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like virtually all of our state’s businesses, physician practices have
      been financially impacted by the pandemic. Telemedicine payment parity has
      been a life raft for many of our state’s practices, helping to keep
      practices afloat and facilitating access to care for patients across the
      state. We thank the OIC for its previous emergency orders providing for
      payment parity for services provided over the telephone or non-HIPAA
      compliant platforms, and urge you to continue to extend these provisions
      until the end of the public health emergency.
