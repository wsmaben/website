         The expertise, experience, and perspective of physicians and physician
         assistants practicing in Washington is crucial to helping to inform our
         advocacy on your behalf. And, it's often crucial in helping to inform
         legislators' decision-making on policy being debated at the state and
         federal levels.
      </p>
      <p>
         On this page, we'll highlight some of WSMA's top advocacy priorities
         where lawmakers need to hear from physicians and PAs directly.
      </p>

      <h2 id="TakeActionTellCongressToSupportHR8702">
         Take Action: Tell Congress to Support H.R. 8702
      </h2>

      <p>
         With its 2021 Medicare physician fee schedule final rule, CMS is
         restructuring and revaluing the office-based evaluation and management
         codes in alignment with broad changes made in 2019. While the final
         rule provides an increase in payments for primary care and other
         office-based services, the effect will be a 10.2% reduction to the
         Medicare physician fee schedule conversion factor, resulting in drastic
         cuts to certain physician specialties starting Jan. 1. This is due to
         current law requiring any changes to the physician fee schedule to be
         budget neutral.
      </p>

      <p>
         These payment reductions will compound the significant financial
         difficulty that Washington’s physician practices of all specialty types
         have experienced due to COVID-19. While the WSMA is supportive of the
         final rule’s streamlined documentation requirements and increased
         payment for office visits, the impact of corresponding specialty care
         cuts will be devastating to health care professionals, their practices,
         and most importantly, their patients.
      </p>

      <p>
         H.R. 8702, the “Holding Providers Harmless from Medicare Cuts During
         COVID-19 Act,” is bipartisan legislation before Congress that would
         freeze payments at 2020 rates for services scheduled to be cut in 2021
         for a period of two years, while allowing the scheduled E/M increases
         to take place.
      </p>

      <p>
         <strong>
            Please contact your congressional representative today and urge
            continued collaboration and support of H.R. 8702 or another
            legislative remedy to stop forthcoming payment reductions generated
            by budget neutrality requirements.
         </strong>
         Share with them that given the financial pressures many practices and
         medical groups are facing due to COVID-19, now is not the time to
         implement any payment reductions.

         Take Action: Urge Your State Lawmakers to Support Telemedicine Payment
         Parity
      </h2>
      <p>
         The Legislature has granted a brief extension—through Dec. 7 —of Gov.
         Jay Inslee's proclamation temporarily requiring telemedicine payment
         parity. While the WSMA was glad to see the proclamation extended, we
         continue to advocate for the policy to be extended through the end of
         the year, which is when the provisions of Senate Bill 5385, permanently
         requiring payment parity from state-regulated health plans, take
         effect.
      </p>
      <p>
         Similarly, the Office of the Insurance Commissioner has extended its
         emergency order to health insurers expanding telehealth and other
         coverages until Dec. 11, including requiring all state-regulated
         carriers to permit and reimburse for care provided over non-HIPAA
         compliant platforms, including video chat applications and telephones.
      </p>
      <p>
         <strong>
            We need you to act: Please write your local legislators and urge
            them to:
         </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            Extend the governor's telemedicine parity proclamation through Dec.
            31, 2020.
         </li>
         <li>
            Call on the OIC to extend its emergency telemedicine order for the
            duration of the public health crisis.
         </li>
      </ul>

         in effect as the pandemic continues to play out in Washington state.
