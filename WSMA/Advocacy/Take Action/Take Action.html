         The expertise, experience, and perspective of physicians and physician assistants practicing in Washington is crucial to helping to inform
         our advocacy on your behalf. And, it's often crucial in helping to inform legislators' decision-making on policy being debated at the state
         and federal levels.
      </p>
      <p>On this page, we'll highlight some of WSMA's top advocacy priorities where lawmakers need to hear from physicians and PAs directly.</p>
      <br />
      <h2 id="OpposePierceCountyProposedOrdinanceNo2020136">Oppose Pierce County Proposed Ordinance No. 2020-136</h2>
      <p>
         The WSMA is severely troubled by a proposal pending before the Pierce County Council to terminate the interlocal agreement between the City
         of Tacoma and Pierce County that established the joint Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department.
      </p>
      <p>
         The ordinance being considered by the Pierce County Council (<a
            href="https://online.co.pierce.wa.us/cfapps/council/iview/proposal.cfm?proposal_num=2020-136"
            >available here</a
         >) is hasty, poorly timed, and could have severe negative consequences on public health. The WSMA strongly agrees with the Tacoma-Pierce
         County Health Department’s <a href="https://www.tpchd.org/Home/Components/News/News/206/286?backlist=%2fhome">response</a> that “efforts that
         divide our attention from this critical public health response are an unfortunate distraction.”
      </p>
      <p>
         Now, during the worst public health crisis in more than a century, is not the time to distract Pierce County's public health leaders from
         taking care of the health and well-being of their constituents.
      </p>
      <p>
         The first hearing on the resolution is Dec. 7 with a planned final vote scheduled for Dec. 15.
         <strong>Please call and email your district’s council member today and urge them to oppose this proposal.</strong>

      <h2 id="TakeActionTellCongressToSupportHR8702">Take Action: Tell Congress to Support H.R. 8702</h2>

      <p>
         With its 2021 Medicare physician fee schedule final rule, CMS is restructuring and revaluing the office-based evaluation and management codes
         in alignment with broad changes made in 2019. While the final rule provides an increase in payments for primary care and other office-based
         services, the effect will be a 10.2% reduction to the Medicare physician fee schedule conversion factor, resulting in drastic cuts to certain
         physician specialties starting Jan. 1. This is due to current law requiring any changes to the physician fee schedule to be budget neutral.
      </p>

      <p>
         These payment reductions will compound the significant financial difficulty that Washington’s physician practices of all specialty types have
         experienced due to COVID-19. While the WSMA is supportive of the final rule’s streamlined documentation requirements and increased payment
         for office visits, the impact of corresponding specialty care cuts will be devastating to health care professionals, their practices, and
         most importantly, their patients.
      </p>

      <p>
         H.R. 8702, the “Holding Providers Harmless from Medicare Cuts During COVID-19 Act,” is bipartisan legislation before Congress that would
         freeze payments at 2020 rates for services scheduled to be cut in 2021 for a period of two years, while allowing the scheduled E/M increases
         to take place.
      </p>

            remedy to stop forthcoming payment reductions generated by budget neutrality requirements. </strong
         >Share with them that given the financial pressures many practices and medical groups are facing due to COVID-19, now is not the time to
         implement any payment reductions.

      <h2 id="TakeActionUrgeYourStateLawmakersToSupportTelemedicinePaymentParity">
         Take Action: Urge Your State Lawmakers to Support Telemedicine Payment Parity
      </h2>
      <p>
         The Legislature has granted a brief extension—through Dec. 7 —of Gov. Jay Inslee's proclamation temporarily requiring telemedicine payment
         parity. While the WSMA was glad to see the proclamation extended, we continue to advocate for the policy to be extended through the end of
         the year, which is when the provisions of Senate Bill 5385, permanently requiring payment parity from state-regulated health plans, take
         effect.
      </p>
      <p>
         Similarly, the Office of the Insurance Commissioner has extended its emergency order to health insurers expanding telehealth and other
         coverages until Dec. 11, including requiring all state-regulated carriers to permit and reimburse for care provided over non-HIPAA compliant
         platforms, including video chat applications and telephones.
      </p>
      <p>
         <strong>We need you to act: Please write your local legislators and urge them to:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>Extend the governor's telemedicine parity proclamation through Dec. 31, 2020.</li>
         <li>Call on the OIC to extend its emergency telemedicine order for the duration of the public health crisis.</li>
      </ul>

         Physicians and practices need certainty that these policies will remain in effect as the pandemic continues to play out in Washington state.

      <h2 id="TakeActionTellCongressToPrioritizePatientsAndPhysicians">Take Action: Tell Congress to Prioritize Patients and Physicians</h2>
      <p>
         As Congress debates the next round of financial stimulus policies, the WSMA is advocating for more support for the physician community. You
         can help. Congressional action is needed on three issues that are critically important for ensuring patient access to care and physician
         practice viability during the COVID-19 pandemic:
      </p>
      <ol>
         <li>Requiring ERISA plans to pay at parity for telemedicine services.</li>
         <li>Enacting liability protections for health care workers as part of the next stimulus package.</li>
         <li>Prioritizing direct support to physician practices in the next stimulus package.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
         <a href="https://takeaction.wsma.org/tell-congress-to-prioritize-patients-and-physicians/" class="TextButton">TAKE ACTION</a>
      </p>
      <p>
         Elected officials in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives need to hear from their physician and PA constituents on these issues. Take
         action today.
