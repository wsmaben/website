    <p>
      We have shared those principles with members of Congress and others as we
      work to maintain the good aspects of the Affordable Care Act, refine
      troublesome regulations that hinder good patient care, and look for
      opportunities to insert reforms that were missing the first time around.

      WSMA Principles for Health Care Reform
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Pursue universal access to comprehensive, high-quality, safe, affordable
        health care for all Washingtonians through health care coverage options
        that are designed to encourage participation of physicians and
        practices.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ensure adequate funding of public programs such as Medicaid and Medicare
        in every community so that patients have access to affordable coverage
        and physicians receive adequate reimbursement.
      </li>
      <li>
        Develop a health care delivery system and payment models that enable
        medical practices to remain viable in their communities and promote
        cost-effective, quality health care.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preserve the ability of those who received access to insurance under the
        original Affordable Care Act to maintain coverage at affordable premium
        rates.
      </li>
      <li>
        Recent essential insurance market reforms should be preserved: no
        exclusion of coverage despite pre-existing condition; children should
        have the option to remain on their parents' plans through age 26;
        exclude lifetime caps on benefits; support for preventive care.
      </li>
      <li>
        Strengthen and stabilize the health insurance market, including the
        individual market, to ensure choice and the ongoing participation of a
        number of regional and national health insurers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce regulatory and administrative burdens that impede physicians'
        capacity to provide optimal, patient-centric care.
      </li>
      <li>
        Implement tort reform to preserve access to care and contain costs
        associated with "defensive medicine."
      </li>
      <li>
        Ensure health care equity and access for minority, underserved and
        special-needs populations.
      </li>
      <li>Seek solutions to achieve affordability of prescription drugs.</li>
    </ul>
