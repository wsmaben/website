         <strong>
            The WSMA advocates for physicians' interests in the court system by
            initiating lawsuits and by filing "friend of the court," or amicus
            curiae, briefs that argue a physician-centric perspective.
         </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
         The drafting of such briefs is resource intensive, and the WSMA
         generally retains outside counsel who specialize in writing these
         briefs. Because of the cost, the WSMA must be selective in allocating
         its resources to amicus briefs. Funding for these services comes
         primarily from the WSMA, though the WSMA often partners with other
         organizations such as the Washington State Hospital Association,
         Physicians Insurance and/or the American Medical Association to share
         the expenditure of resources and increase the impact of the amicus
         arguments.
      </p>
      <h2>Amicus curiae case selection criteria</h2>
      <p>
         When determining whether or not to provide assistance to a particular
         litigant, we consider:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>The parties directly involved and the merits of their claims.</li>
         <li>
            Whether the legal issues extend or clarify the case law on a matter
            relevant to Washington physicians generally.
         </li>
         <li>
            The precedential value of the case (i.e., level of court,
            jurisdiction, and nature of legal proceeding).
         </li>
         <li>Whether the legal argument is likely to succeed.</li>
         <li>The expense the WSMA would incur.</li>
         <li>
            The probability that other organizations will partner with the WSMA
            to share the expense.
         </li>
         <li>
            The extent of non-financial costs (e.g., whether litigation makes
            political and other options less feasible, how it will affect our
            relationship with important individuals and groups).
         </li>
         <li>The membership status of the requesting individual.</li>
         <li>Whether other, non-litigious options are available.</li>
      </ul>

               Court sides with WSMA in case scrutinizing standards for expert
               testimony
            </h3>
            <p>
               In a 7-2 decision favoring WSMA's position, the Washington State
               Supreme Court handed down a ruling in Reyes v. Yakima Health
               District that found a declaration from the plaintiff's expert
               witness insufficient to establish medical negligence. This is
               important because the case could have lowered the standards for
               pretrial statements from expert witnesses regarding the standard
               of care in medical malpractice cases.
            </p>
            <p>
               In this case, brought against a treating physician and the Yakima
               Health District, an expert witness for the plaintiff submitted a
               declaration stating that the physician violated the standard of
               care, yet failed to specify what the standard of care in the case
               should have been.
            </p>
            <p>
               The trial court had granted summary judgment for the defendants
               on the medical malpractice claim and on the other claims. The
               court of appeals had upheld that decision. When the state Supreme
               Court decided to take up the case, we submitted a brief urging
               the court to do the same.
            </p>
            <p>
               We were pleased to see the court side with our arguments,
               ultimately deciding that an expert witness' declaration must
               state the standard of care before concluding that the defendant
               had violated said standard. The WSMA, joined by the American
               Medical Association, the Washington Chapter of the American
               College of Emergency Physicians, and supported by Physicians
               Insurance, submitted a brief in the case urging, among other
               things, for the court to preserve the current standards, and we
               are pleased to see the court do so.

            <h3>
               State Supreme Court agrees with WSMA brief in tort case involving
               jurisdiction
            </h3>
            <p>
               The WSMA is pleased to report that the Washington Supreme Court
               recently dismissed a medical malpractice claim that, if it had
               succeeded, could have endangered the ability of patients in our
               border communities to access care.
            </p>
            <p>
               The case, Swank v. Valley Christian School, required the court to
               consider whether personal jurisdiction, a legal term referring to
               a court's authority to hear a case, could allow an Idahoan
               plaintiff to sue an Idahoan defendant using a Washington law in a
               Washington court, if the alleged medical negligence occurred in
               Idaho but the plaintiff injuries occurred in Washington.
            </p>
            <p>
               The facts of this case, like many medical malpractice cases, were
               tragic. The plaintiff, Drew Swank, was a 17-year-old high-school
               football player who was temporarily removed from play after
               suffering a concussion during a game. Washington recently enacted
               the Lystedt Law, which seeks to protect youths from athletic
               injuries by requiring certain clearances before student athletes
               resume playing. Drew's physician in Idaho evaluated Drew,
               clearing him to play one week later. In a subsequent game, Swank
               was hit and collapsed, and later died in the hospital. His family
               sued the physician, the football coach and the school for which
               Swank had played.
            </p>
            <p>
               The WSMA, joined by the American Medical Association, the Oregon
               Medical Association, the Idaho Medical Association and the Idaho
               Academy of Family Physicians, submitted
               <a
                  href="https://www.courts.wa.gov/content/Briefs/A08/932824%20Amicus%20-%20AMA,%20WA%20Med.%20Assoc.,%20et%20al.pdf"
               >
                  an amicus brief
               </a>
               arguing that a physician should not be sued in a state with which
               he has no contact. The WSMA was concerned that many physicians in
               Idaho or Oregon who see Washington patients close to borders
               could be dragged into court proceedings in Washington, despite
               never having practiced there. This could lead to fear of treating
               cross-border patients who might then have a harder time finding
               physicians close to these state borders to provide care.
            </p>
            <p>
               In a 9-0 decision, the court ruled in favor of the physician.
               <a href="https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/932824.pdf">
                  In its opinion
               </a>
               , the court implicitly agreed with the position taken in our
               brief, dismissing the case for lack of personal jurisdiction. The
               court explained that the Lystedt Law does allow individuals
               adversely affected by youth sports-related head injuries to sue
               coaches and others if they believe those in charge did not comply
               with the law; however, the court notably refused to expand
               personal jurisdiction, addressing the issue in a very
               straightforward discussion at the end of its opinion. We were
               especially pleased to see the court affirm one of our points in
               its opinion: that (legally) a medical tort occurs where the care
               is rendered, not where a patient happens to be when the injury
               manifests.
            </p>
            <p>
               In our brief's conclusion, we noted that the Swank family had
               suffered a terrible loss, but that the physicians we represent
               strive every day to help patients like Drew and their families.
               We argued that accepting the argument the Swanks made here would
               have hurt, not helped, the effort to promote effective medical
               care in our state and across the nation, and we are pleased to
               see the court dismiss the malpractice claim against the
               physician.
            </p>

               We would like to thank our fellow amici, the American Medical
               Association, the Oregon Medical Association, the Idaho Medical
               Association and the Idaho Academy of Family Physicians, for their

               State Supreme Court agrees with WSMA in decision addressing
               medical malpractice testimony
            </h3>
            <p>
               The WSMA is celebrating a significant decision by the Washington
               State Supreme Court in a case addressing who may testify about a
               physician's standard of care in a medical negligence lawsuit.
            </p>
            <p>
               In Frausto v. Yakima HMA LLC (Yakima Regional), a pediatric
               advanced registered nurse practitioner was hired as an expert
               witness to testify on behalf of the plaintiff, a man with
               quadriplegia who developed pressure sores while in a hospital.
               The ARNP testified that the pressure sores were caused by the
               nursing care and the care of the plaintiff's physician. The
               physician was not named as a defendant, just the hospital and its
               employed nurses.
            </p>
            <p>
               With this case, the primary question before the court was whether
               an ARNP could testify as to causation in a medical negligence
               lawsuit, something that previously had been the purview of only
               physicians. Another important concern was if the court might even
               go so far as to allow ARNPs to testify in a medical negligence
               case involving physicians.
            </p>
            <p>
               In an

               >
                  amicus brief
               </a>
               submitted to the court, the WSMA argued that an ARNP should only
               be allowed to testify as to causation in the area in which she/he
               has received specialized training. In its
               <a href="https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/933120.pdf">
                  decision
               </a>
               , the court agreed, maintaining its position that only physicians
               may testify about a physician's standard of care. The court held
               that ARNPs may testify on questions of causation and standard of
               care in a medical negligence lawsuit against a nurse only if the
               court determines the ARNP is qualified to testify as an expert
               under the rules of evidence. This must be done on a case-by-case
               basis.
            </p>
            <p>
               The WSMA would like to extend its thanks and appreciation to our
               partners in this amicus curiae brief, the Litigation Center of
               the American Medical Association, the Washington Academy of

               College of Emergency Physicians.

            <h3>
               WSMA victory in state Supreme Court medical malpractice case
               considering burden of proof
            </h3>
            <p>
               In a case that could have had profound consequences for
               physicians and other health care providers, the Washington
               Supreme Court handed down a most welcome 9-0 decision in
               Dunnington v. VMMC
               <em>,</em>
               protecting the established burden of proof in medical malpractice
               cases rather than lowering that burden, as a victory for the
               plaintiffs would have done.
            </p>
            <p>
               At issue in the case was a legal question concerning the burden
               of proof of causation in medical malpractice cases when a
               plaintiff alleges loss of chance of a better outcome. While the
               defendant in the case was a podiatrist, a decision against the
               defendant would likely have changed how causation is litigated
               against all health care providers&mdash;lowering the burden of
               proof for loss of a chance of a better outcome and resulting in
               even more defensive medicine.
            </p>
            <p>
               The court also considered whether, if the defendant physician
               relies on a "contributory negligence" legal defense, a jury
               should be allowed to hear evidence related to a patient's failure
               to follow his or her physician's instructions. Fortunately, the
               court also agreed with our position on this issue by determining
               that evidence related to how a patient complied with a
               physician's instructions (or in this case, failed to comply)
               could be presented to the jury when relevant to the defendant's
               contributory negligence defense.
            </p>
            <p>
               The WSMA filed an amicus brief in this case, joined by the
               Washington State Hospital Association, the Washington State
               Radiological Society, the Washington Chapter of the American
               College of Emergency Physicians, and was supported by Physicians
