         Understanding the Regulatory Process
      </h1>
      <p>
         In a typical year, the WSMA tracks a dozen or more rules and submits
         comments on a wide array of issues impacting medicine to various
         regulatory bodies, including the Washington Medical Commission, the
         Department of Health, the Health Care Authority, the Office of the
         Insurance Commissioner, Labor &amp; Industries, and the Department of
         Licensing. While our Olympia team has an intimate understanding of how
         the process works and a strong grasp on how a proposal will impact your
         practice, we are not clinicians; your feedback is critical to help
         guide our approach.
      </p>
      <h2 id="HowItWorks">How It Works</h2>
      <p>
         For all the attention given to the legislative process, rules quietly
         written by bureaucrats carry the same force of law as those written by
         elected officials.
      </p>
      <p>
         In Washington state, language from bills that pass the Legislature and
         are signed into law by the governor is added to the Revised Code of
         Washington (RCW), the compendium of all state laws in force.
         Legislative language will contain specific concepts and goals, while
         often directing regulatory agencies and departments to fill in the
         details through rulemaking.
      </p>
      <p>
         Lawmakers do this for several reasons, including a hesitancy to place
         complicated policy (think about the ever-evolving practice of medicine)
         in the RCW because it is so difficult to update; you have to pass
         another law. Deferring to regulatory bodies provides flexibility.
      </p>
      <p>
         It also offers a more deliberate and comprehensive policymaking arena
         that facilitates expert input through a process not subject to the
         pressures and time constraints of the legislative session. Plus,
         regulatory bodies have the authority to conduct emergency rulemaking
         any time of year (not just when the Legislature is in session) to
         address issues that arise or when required to advance the agency's
         objectives.
      </p>
      <p>
         The Administrative Procedures Act (APA) outlines how the rulemaking
         process must be conducted in our state. In short, an agency or
         department must release a "preproposal statement of inquiry,"
         officially referred to as a CR-101, which is a "heads up" to the public
         that they intend to write a rule. The second step, the CR-102, includes
         draft language and an opportunity to comment. The CR-103 is the final,
         adopted rule. Once finalized, rules are added to the Washington
         Administrative Code (similar to the RCW, the WAC catalogues all state
         regulations).

      <p>
         Each year, the WSMA tracks a dozen or more rules and submits comments
         on a wide array of issues impacting medicine. For example, in 2017, the
         Legislature passed House Bill 1427, which directs relevant boards and
         commissions to write opioid rules for the professions they regulate. We
         worked on the bill while it was under consideration by the Legislature
         and participated in every stage of the rulemaking. We were successful
         in many of our goals, but only because we solicited feedback from WSMA
         members and urged them to submit their thoughts to the state or endorse
         our comprehensive comment letter. The APA requires that each comment be
         considered during the rulemaking process; in short, your feedback
         matters.
      </p>
      <p>
         The WSMA will alert members of opportunities to participate in
         rulemaking in its various email communications, including the
         Membership Memo, Weekly Rounds, and direct calls to action. On the WSMA
