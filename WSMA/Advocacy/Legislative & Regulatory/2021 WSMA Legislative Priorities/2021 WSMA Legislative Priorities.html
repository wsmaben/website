      <h1 class="mobileShow">2021 WSMA Legislative Priorities</h1>
      <p>
         The Washington State Medical Association is the largest medical
         professional association in Washington, representing physicians,
         residents, medical students, and physician assistants from nearly all
         specialties and practice settings throughout the state. The WSMA is the
         only professional organization that represents the interests and
         priorities of all physicians in Washington.

      </p>
      <h3 id="MedicaidReimbursement">Medicaid reimbursement</h3>
      <p>
         Restore the primary care, pediatric, and behavioral health care
         Medicaid reimbursement rate adjustments vetoed by Gov. Jay Inslee in
         2020 due to state budget concerns arising from the pandemic. Restoring
         the rate adjustment will improve access to care for Washingtonians by
         expanding physician participation in Medicaid networks at a time when
         it is desperately needed and long overdue.
      </p>
      <h3 id="Taxes">Taxes</h3>
      <p>
         The physician community acknowledges the state's financial outlook and
         the WSMA welcomes the opportunity to participate in discussions around
         budget and revenue. But it must also be acknowledged that physician
         practices and organizations, like many of our state's businesses, have
         been hit hard by the pandemic, at once facing decreased patient volumes
         and increased costs associated with providing care, as well as other
         pressures such as the recent business and occupation (B&O) tax
         increase. While we seek to constructively engage in fiscal negotiations
         we must do so with an eye to the viability of our members, many of whom
         are in a tenuous position.
      </p>
      <h3 id="Telemedicine">Telemedicine</h3>
      <p>
         <a
            href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=1196&Year=2021&Initiative=false"
            >House Bill 1196</a
         >: Audio-only telemedicine allows patients to receive care over the
         telephone, advancing the goal of ensuring they get the right care, in
         the right place, and the right time by improving the opportunity to get
         healthcare closer to home, in a convenient, timely manner. Insurers are
         currently required to cover and pay for audio-only services, but action
         is needed to ensure that patients can continue to receive appropriate
         care over the phone.

      <h3 id="HealthEquityCME">Health equity CME</h3>
      <p>
         <a
            href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=5229&Initiative=false&Year=2021"
            >Senate Bill 5229</a
         >: Direct the boards and commissions of all health professions licensed
         under Title 18 RCW to adopt rules establishing a health equity CME
         requirement at least once every four years to provide health care
         professionals with tools to care for patients of diverse identities and
         backgrounds and to be knowledgeable about cultural sensitivities,
         patterns of disparities, and implicit bias, all of which can impact
         patient care and health outcomes. While this is not a catch-all
         solution, it is an important step to promote the progression of health
         equity for all the residents of our state.
      </p>
      <h3 id="PPEReimbursement">PPE reimbursement</h3>
      <p>
         <a
            href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=5169&Initiative=false&Year=2021"
            >Senate Bill 5169</a
         >: Require insurance carriers to reimburse for personal protective
         equipment costs that were increased directly as a result of the
         pandemic, as physicians are prohibited from billing for PPE by their
         contracts with health insurers. A necessary step to help spread the
         increased costs of delivering care and ensuring everyone is paying
         their fair share.

            href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=5271&Initiative=false&Year=2021"
            >Senate Bill 5271</a
         >: Establishes a clear method for determining the standard of care for
         health care providers and facilities caring for COVID-19 patients and
         reflects the realities of this challenging time. Physicians have faced
         numerous challenges in delivering care during the pandemic, including
         shortages of supplies and shifting government directives on when and
         how services can be delivered. The standard of care physicians and
         health care providers are held to should reflect the practice
         conditions when care is delivered.
