            >The resources on this page can help you connect with your
            legislator's office during the 2021 Washington State Legislative
            Session to plan a virtual meeting that works with your schedule.
         </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
         As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2021 Washington State
         Legislative Session will be held largely remotely, with the Capitol
         closed to the public in deference to public health guidelines. While
         WSMA's government affairs team will continue to advocate for the house
         of medicine in this new virtual setting, there's still no substitute
         for physicians connecting directly with their local legislators. The
         experience and knowledge of physicians can provide critical context for
         lawmakers as they consider policy changes that impact the practice of
         medicine.
      </p>

         FAQ on Meeting with Your Legislators
      </h2>
      <p><strong>How do I know who my state legislators are?</strong></p>
      <p>
         Use the Legislature's
         <a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/DistrictFinder/">District Finder</a> to
         identify your state legislators. Be sure to enter your home address.
         Make sure the preferred district type is legislative (you can also use
         this feature to look up your congressional representatives). Once your
         district is located, the names of three state legislators will appear:
         one state senator and two state representatives.
      </p>
      <p>
         <strong
            >Where can I find contact information for my state
            legislators?</strong
         >
      </p>
      <p>
         The Legislature's website features a
         <a href="https://leg.wa.gov/Senate/Senators/Pages/default.aspx"
            >directory for Washington state senators</a
         >
         and a
         <a href="https://leg.wa.gov/house/representatives/Pages/default.aspx"
            >directory for Washington state representatives</a
         >. Legislators are listed in alphabetical order by last name. These
         directories also include links to the legislator's website, their
         contact information, party affiliation, leadership positions, and the
         committees the legislator serves on.
      </p>
      <p>
         Alternatively,
         <a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/Rosters/Members"
            >a roster of all House and Senate members</a
         >
         is available, along with their contact information and their
         legislative assistants.
      </p>
      <p>
         <strong
            >How should I reach out to my state legislators to request a
            meeting?</strong
         >
      </p>
      <p>
         Email is the preferred method of communication during session. Send
         your meeting request to your legislator and be sure to ‘cc' their
         legislative assistant. These assistants keep legislators' schedules, so
         your odds of getting a meeting will be increased.
      </p>
      <p>
         Make sure the subject line of the email can clearly be identified as a
         meeting request. If you are a constituent, include that too as
         legislators make every attempt to connect with folks in their
         legislative district. You may also include the topic of the meeting –
         if you are reaching out to discuss WSMA's
         <a
            href="[@]WSMA/Advocacy/Legislative___Regulatory/2021_WSMA_Legislative_Priorities/WSMA/Advocacy/Legislative_Regulatory/2021_WSMA_Legislative_Priorities/2021_WSMA_Legislative_Priorities.aspx?hkey=cecc3084-6ca1-47e6-b8e7-d7f8f407ad0c"
            >2021 legislative priorities</a
         >
         simply put ‘WSMA priorities.' If you are reaching out on a specific
         issue, name it.
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            Example subject line: Physician constituent meeting request / WSMA
            priorities
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The body of the email needs to include six things:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Your name/affiliation and contact information</li>
         <li>
            Whether you are a constituent (you may want to include your address,
            so the office can confirm you are a constituent).
         </li>
         <li>A request for a virtual meeting with your legislator</li>
         <li>The topic of the meeting</li>
         <li>A timeframe for the meeting (e.g., "in the next two weeks")</li>
         <li>
            Your availability (legislators will have very strict schedules
            during session and while their offices will work with you to find a
            date/time that works for all parties, if you know you are widely
            available on Tuesdays or during lunch hours, it can be helpful to
            share that information).
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
         If helpful, please review and/or use the following email template when
         contacting your legislators:

            member of the Washington State Medical Association, I would like the

            >When should I reach out to my state legislators for a virtual
            meeting?</strong
         >
      </p>
      <p>
         As soon as possible. Due to the nature of a virtual session, it may
         take longer to get a virtual meeting scheduled with legislators as
         their offices will be handling a high volume of requests. Ideally, your
         virtual meeting will take place during the legislative session, which
         runs from January to April.
      </p>
      <p>
         In the meantime, you may let your legislator know your stance on
         pending legislation by emailing articles, responding to WSMA's calls to
         action, or sharing your related personal experiences. Please remember
         to be respectful to legislators and their staff during these
         interactions, particularly in terms of the number of inquiries or
         information sharing emails you share. No spamming!
      </p>
      <p><strong>When should I expect a reply?</strong></p>
      <p>
         Be patient. If you haven't received a response within one or two weeks,
         don't be afraid to follow up to inquire about the status of your
         meeting request. Email Alex Wehinger at
         <a href="mailto:alex@wsma.org">alex@wsma.org</a> for assistance.
      </p>
      <p><strong>What will the meeting format look like?</strong></p>
      <p>
         All legislator meetings with the public will be conducted virtually.
         Legislators will use Microsoft Teams and/or Zoom. The legislator's
         office will provide connection details, so you do not need access to
         your own account to meet with your legislators.
      </p>
      <p>
         If you have concerns about broadband capabilities, legislative offices
         may also schedule a phone meeting if you let them know that is
         preferred.
      </p>
      <p>
         Most meetings during session last 15 minutes, and legislators may have
         back-to-back virtual meetings, so they will need to stay on schedule.
      </p>
      <p>
         If your legislator is unable to meet directly, they may request a
         member of their staff meet with you on their behalf. Their staff member
         will relay what was discussed to the legislator.

               >WSMA's priority issues</a
            >
            to discuss (remember that you only have 15 minutes)
            <ul>
               <li>
                  Share why those issues are important to you: how they will
                  impact you, your patients, your practice, and/or your
                  profession.

               <li>Personal anecdotes can be very effective.</li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>
            Leave some time for your legislator to ask questions. Building a
            rapport with your legislator is important; think of the meeting more
            as a conversation than a presentation.
         </li>

            Offer to be a resource in the future to your legislator and thank

         <li>
            Follow up with your legislator with a "thank you." You are
            establishing a relationship, and a thank you note will go a long
            way. A thank you email is also an opportune time to share

      <h2>Other Advocacy Opportunities</h2>
      <p>
         In addition to meeting with your state legislators, you may consider
         other advocacy opportunities that are typically limited by your ability
         to travel to the Capitol. The Legislature has provided the below
         resources on how to provide testimony during a committee hearing and
         "sign-in" on a bill. These instructions may be subject to change as the
         Legislature navigates these processes in the virtual setting.
      </p>
      <p>
         Committee hearings and floor debate will be broadcast live and archived
         for review on <a href="https://www.tvw.org/">TVW</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>Virtual testimony</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>
            You have the opportunity to provide written testimony, state your
            position on a bill, or register to testify remotely via
            videoconference by registering at the Legislature's
            <a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/csiremote">committee sign-in page</a
            >.
         </li>

            Note that registering to testify does not guarantee you a chance to
            speak or speak at specific times. Time constraints, technical
            issues, changes to committee schedules, etc. could affect your
            ability to testify.
