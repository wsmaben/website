      <h1>Become a Grassroots Advocate</h1>
      <p>
         <strong
            >The WSMA works year-round to advocate for your interests and those
            of your patients. You, too, can become a year-round advocate to help
            further policies to support your practice and patients.</strong
         >
      </p>
      <p>Four steps to becoming a year-round grassroots advocate:</p>
      <h3>#1. Build relationships with your legislators</h3>
      <p>
         What a policymaker learns from constituents in their home districts can
         shape their decisions when they make policy decisions, many of which
         stand to impact you, your practice, and your patients. Legislators want
         to hear from their constituents.
         <a
            href="[@]WSMA/Advocacy/Become_a_Grassroots_Advocate/Get_to_Know_Your_Legislators/Get_to_Know_Your_Legislators.aspx"
            >Learn how to build relationships with your elected officials and
            talk about issues after legislative session</a
         >.
      </p>
      <h3>#2. Attend the WSMA Legislative Summit</h3>
      <p>
         Timed to coincide with the state legislative session, this yearly event
         gives WSMA members an opportunity to talk with lawmakers about top
         legislative issues identified by the WSMA as benefiting the most from
         physician perspective.
         <a href="[@]WSMA/Events/Legislative_Summit/Legislative_Summit.aspx"
            >Learn more about the WSMA Legislative Summit and plan now to
            attend</a
         >.
      </p>
      <h3>#3. Respond to WSMA’s calls to action</h3>
      <p>
         In the digital age, email has emerged as a precise, powerful advocacy
         tool. Hearing from constituents during the state legislative session
         can help inform their decision-making on policy being proposed.
      </p>
      <p>
         During the 2019 legislative session, the WSMA sent out 13 calls to
         action resulting in physicians sending more than 6,000 messages to
         state legislators. Make sure you’re receiving these important calls to
         action by verifying that your contact information at the WSMA is up to
         date. To check your member profile, sign in at the top of this page or
         call 206.441.9762 for personal assistance.
      </p>
      <h3>#4. Provide testimony at public hearings</h3>
      <p>
         Public testimony during the state legislative session is an important
         part of policymaking. It’s one way that legislators get up to speed on
         the issues confronting them. As a physician, your testimony on health
         care policy lends gravity and expertise that can help determine the
         fate of a bill.

            >The WSMA provides tips for testifying in Olympia and is looking for
            willing physician experts to lend their expertise during public
            hearings</a
         >.
