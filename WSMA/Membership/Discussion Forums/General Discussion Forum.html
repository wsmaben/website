        >WSMA's general discussion forum gives members an opportunity to discuss
        proposed policy ideas prior to submitting as a formal resolution.
        Members may also use the general forum to discuss general topics of
        interest.</strong

    <h2>About the general discussion forum</h2>
    <p>
      Access the members-only general discussion forum below. Use the general
      discussion forum to develop your policy idea before you submit your
      resolution for consideration by the House of Delegates. Tapping the
      expertise of your colleagues can help you hone your proposal and increase
      its chances for adoption. You can also use the general discussion forum to
      start discussions that don't directly relate to a resolution.
    </p>
    <h2>Forum rules</h2>
    <p>
      As these online forums are for members only, you will be prompted to sign

      organization, please include that information in your post/reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The WSMA encourages lively debate, but please behave courteously and
      responsibly. Comments that include profanity, personal attacks or
      inappropriate, offensive or illegal material will be removed.
