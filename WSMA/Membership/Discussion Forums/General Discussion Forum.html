		<p>
			<strong>WSMA's general discussion forum gives members an opportunity to discuss proposed policy ideas prior to submitting as a formal resolution. Members may also use the general forum to discuss general topics of interest.</strong>

		<h2>About the general discussion forum</h2>
		<p>Access the members-only general discussion forum below. Use the general discussion forum to develop your policy idea before you submit your resolution for consideration by the House of Delegates. Tapping the expertise of your colleagues can help you hone your proposal and increase its chances for adoption. You can also use the general discussion forum to start discussions that don't directly relate to a resolution.</p>
		<h2>Forum rules</h2>
		<p>As these online forums are for members only, you will be prompted to sign in to enter the forum. When you post a topic or a reply, your name will appear with your post or reply. If you are speaking on behalf of an organization, please include that information in your post/reply.</p>
		<p>The WSMA encourages lively debate, but please behave courteously and responsibly. Comments that include profanity, personal attacks or inappropriate, offensive or illegal material will be removed.</p>
		<p>By using the WSMA's websites and discussion forums, you agree to comply and be bound by the terms of use and related policies, which you find on our <a href="[@]Shared_Content/Footer/Privacy_and_Policies.aspx">Privacy and Policies page</a>.</p>
