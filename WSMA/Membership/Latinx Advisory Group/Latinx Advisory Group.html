              Dr. Aguilar-Gaxiola’s applied research program has focused on
              identifying unmet mental health needs and associated risk and
              protective factors to better understand and meet population mental
              health needs and achieve equity in health and mental health
              disparities in underserved populations. He is also very active
              translating health, mental health and substance abuse research
              knowledge into practical information that is of public health
              value to consumers, service administrators, and policy makers. He
              is the on-site principal investigator of and conducted the Mexican
              American Prevalence and Services Survey (MAPSS) – the second
              largest mental health study done in the U.S. on Mexican Americans
              funded by NIMH and the largest population-based comprehensive
              study done on farmworkers’ mental health, which also included
              Mixtecos. In the MAPSS study, he identified the most prevalent
              health and mental health disorders in the Mexican-origin
              population in California’s Fresno County and reported that the
              rate of disorders increases the longer the individual resides in
              the U.S and demonstrated that children of immigrants have even
              greater rates of mental disorders. From the results of this study,
              the research team developed a model of service delivery that
              increased access to mental health services among the Central
              Valley’s low-income, underserved, rural populations. He is a
              Multiple Principal Investigator (MPI) on two National Institute of
              Health-funded ÓRALE COVID-19! project (a part of the RADx-UP
              national initiative) and the UC Davis STOP COVID-19 CA (a part of
              the CEAL national initiative) focusing his work primarily on
              farmworkers.
