         To qualify for emeritus status, a retired member has to have been a
         member of the WSMA or a constituent or component association (a state
         medical association or a national specialty society/association) of the
         AMA for 25 years or more.
      </p>
      <p>
         Most WSMA members who are insured by
         <a href="https://www.phyins.com/">Physicians Insurance</a>
         receive a discount of $300 on their liability insurance premium. Call
         Physicians Insurance at 206.343.7300 for details.
      </p>
      <p>
         WSMA dues include a $25 allocation that can be designated for the
         <a href="[@]WSMA/Advocacy/WAMPAC/WAMPAC.aspx">
            Washington Medical Political Action Committee (WAMPAC)
         </a>
         , WSMA's nonpartisan political action committee, or the
         <a href="[@]WSMA/About/WSMA_Foundation/WSMA_Foundation.aspx">
            WSMA Foundation for Health Care Improvement
         </a>
         , a not-for-profit 501(c)(3) corporation which supports improvements in
         the quality and delivery of health care services for all
         Washingtonians. When paying your dues, please select WAMPAC or WSMA
         Foundation to indicate where you'd like your allocation directed. If
         you're prohibited from giving to a PAC or a 501(c)(3) for any reason,
         your allocation can go directly to the WSMA. Should you allocate $25 to
         the WSMA Foundation, it is 100% tax deductible.
      </p>
      <p>
         <strong>NOTE:</strong>
         In most cases, a portion of the medical association dues may be
         deductible for tax purposes as professional or business expenses. The
         Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993 states that association dues used
         for lobbying activities are not deductible as a business expense. As a
         result, a portion of your WSMA dues cannot be deducted as a business
         expense for federal income tax purposes. See below for current
         non-deductible lobbying percentage rates. No portion of any dues paid
         to WAMPAC can be deducted as a business expense on your federal income
         tax return.
      </p>
      <p>
         2021 non-deductible lobbying percentage rate is 12%.
         <br />
         2020 non-deductible lobbying percentage rate is 12%.
         <br />
         2019 non-deductible lobbying percentage rate is 12%.
