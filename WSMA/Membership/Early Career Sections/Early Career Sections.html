                     Dr. Oluyitan-Okeze, MD, loves family medicine and the
                     opportunity it provides to be an integral part of patient
                     care. Establishing strong, life-long relationships with
                     patients is the reason she chose family medicine. Her
                     patient philosophy focuses on getting to know people, not
                     patients. She has a passion for public and global health.
                     In her free time, she enjoys traveling with her family,
                     eating at new restaurants, reading/listening to audiobook
                     autobiographies, and snorkeling.

                     Dr. Grierson is a board-certified physiatrist with
                     subspecialty board certification in sports medicine. Dr.
                     Grierson earned his medical degree from Boston University
                     and completed his residency in physical medicine and
                     rehabilitation at the University of Washington, where he
                     also served as chief resident. Having experienced his fair
                     share of dance-related injuries, Dr. Grierson appreciates
                     the importance of finding a physician who understands the
                     functional impact of an injury. He is medical director of
                     the Clinic for Performing Artists (CoPA) at Seattle Spine
                     and Sports Medicine and is committed to helping all
                     patients across the spectrum of age, ability, and function.
                     Outside of work, Dr. Grierson assists in shaping health
                     care policy through his work with the WSMA and the American
                     Medical Association. He co-founded a local non-profit
                     (SeaPAM) that provides treatment to local performing
                     artists who otherwise would not have access to care. When
                     he has time, he loves spending time hiking or skiing in the
                     mountains or baking decadent desserts in the kitchen.

                     <br />
                     Dr. Grierson is a board-certified physiatrist with
                     subspecialty board certification in sports medicine. Dr.
                     Grierson earned his medical degree from Boston University
                     and completed his residency in physical medicine and
                     rehabilitation at the University of Washington, where he
                     also served as chief resident. Having experienced his fair
                     share of dance-related injuries, Dr. Grierson appreciates
                     the importance of finding a physician who understands the
                     functional impact of an injury. He is medical director of
                     the Clinic for Performing Artists (CoPA) at Seattle Spine
                     and Sports Medicine and is committed to helping all
                     patients across the spectrum of age, ability, and function.
                     Outside of work, Dr. Grierson assists in shaping health
                     care policy through his work with the WSMA and the American
                     Medical Association. He co-founded a local non-profit
                     (SeaPAM) that provides treatment to local performing
                     artists who otherwise would not have access to care. When
                     he has time, he loves spending time hiking or skiing in the
                     mountains or baking decadent desserts in the kitchen.

                     WSU Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine, Spokane
                     <br />
                     Prior to medical school, Carly graduated from the
                     University of Oregon with a bachelor's degree in human
                     physiology and then from University College London with a
                     master's degree in global health and development. She then
                     worked at a community health center in Wenatchee, helping
                     to lead the outreach department. Her professional interests
                     include global health, child health, post-operative pain
                     management, and the use of mobile medicine to serve
                     underserved populations, and her personal interests include
                     traveling and adventuring. As a member of the Medical
                     Student Section, she is interested to learn more about
                     health care policy, advocacy, and ways in which
                     practitioners can make a positive impact on the health care
                     system.

                     <br />
                     Erin Hegarty grew up in the Tri-Cities, before attending
                     Baylor University for her bachelors degree in health
                     science studies and the University of North Carolina for
                     her masters degree in sport administration. Before coming
                     to the University of Washington, she spent a year coaching
                     cross country and track at the University of Toledo in
                     Toledo, Ohio. She is very much enjoying being a medical
                     student and resident of Spokane. Something about which Erin
                     is particularly passionate is the impact the practice of
                     medicine has on the environment. Erin is excited about the
                     opportunity to serve the University of Washington - Spokane
                     as its WSMA representative and looks forward to learning

                     <br />
                     Erin Johnson's journey to medicine started with a love for
                     teaching and witnessing the many disparities in low income
                     and underserved populations while volunteering in free
                     medical clinics in Montana and Seattle. She graduated from
                     Seattle Pacific University in 2013 with a Bachelor of
                     Science in physiology. From there she attended Bastyr
                     University's Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine program in
                     Kenmore, Washington. Knowing that continuation of schooling
                     was necessary to meet patients' needs in Washington state,
                     she determined to return to school to further her
                     education. She is honored to be part of a medical school
                     that focuses on community needs and advancement of health
                     and science. She is also looking forward to participating
                     in WSMA's Medical Student Council to create change and
                     improve health care delivery. During her free time, she
                     enjoys running, hiking, playing guitar and singing, camping
                     with her husband, Jack, and riding horses. She grew up in
                     Whitefish, Montana and has spent the last 10 years in
                     Seattle attending school, volunteering, and working.

                     Dr. Grierson is a board-certified physiatrist with
                     subspecialty board certification in sports medicine. Dr.
                     Grierson earned his medical degree from Boston University
                     and completed his residency in physical medicine and
                     rehabilitation at the University of Washington, where he
                     also served as chief resident. Having experienced his fair
                     share of dance-related injuries, Dr. Grierson appreciates
                     the importance of finding a physician who understands the
                     functional impact of an injury. He is medical director of
                     the Clinic for Performing Artists (CoPA) at Seattle Spine
                     and Sports Medicine and is committed to helping all
                     patients across the spectrum of age, ability, and function.
                     Outside of work, Dr. Grierson assists in shaping health
                     care policy through his work with the WSMA and the American
                     Medical Association. He co-founded a local non-profit
                     (SeaPAM) that provides treatment to local performing
                     artists who otherwise would not have access to care. When
                     he has time, he loves spending time hiking or skiing in the
                     mountains or baking decadent desserts in the kitchen.
