      <h2>Records management</h2>
      <p>
         The WSMA is pleased to endorse Spectrum Information Services Northwest
         (SIS NW) which offers easy and affordable solutions that reduce the
         expense and liability risks of managing your patients' records. SIS NW
         can assume custodianship of all records, reducing your risk of HIPAA
         violations. Patient records are stored electronically in a
         HIPAA-compliant secure repository. Records requests are fulfilled
         quickly and professionally. A one-time payment covers all future
         releases, and protects you from rising storage costs. All records
         requests are tracked electronically with a complete audit trail. With
         offices in Seattle and Portland, SIS NW can relieve this considerable
         burden. Call SIS NW at 206.686.2827 or visit
         <a href="http://www.sisnwinc.com/wsma">their website</a> to review
         their service offerings.
