    <h2>
      Act by Aug. 1 to Request Exemption from Long-Term Care Insurance Tax
    </h2>

    <p>
      The Washington Long-Term Care Trust Act enacted in 2019 mandates a payroll
      tax at the rate of 0.58% of your and your employees' compensation, with
      tax proceeds earmarked for Washington's new long-term care program
      referred to as the WA Cares Fund.
    </p>
    <p>
      To avoid that tax—which has limited benefits for high-wage earners—you
      must have an alternative long-term care plan in place before you can
      request an exemption from the state program. Despite the act's provision
      for an exemption, there is no guarantee you will receive one, so acting
      quickly is critical.
    </p>
    <p>
      The button below is a link to an on-demand webinar that offers education
      on this new law, and options for you to consider if you choose to purchase
      private long-term care insurance and opt out of the payroll tax.
    </p>

    <h3>Alternative long-term care plans for WSMA members</h3>
    <p>
      The WSMA has entered into an agreement with
      <a href="https://www.wolfltc.com">Wolf & Associates</a> to offer long-term
      care insurance solutions for WSMA members. While the WA Cares Fund goes
      into effect Jan. 1, 2022, you only have until Aug. 1 to purchase an
      alternative plan to apply for an exemption from the state plan. (The
      deadline to file an exemption is Nov. 1, but underwriting the plan takes
      two months.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Why seek an alternative plan to the state plan? Because based on WSMA's
      assessment, the state plan is problematic for:

    <ul>
      <li>High-wage earners</li>
      <li>Anyone retiring within 10 years</li>
      <li>People who plan to live outside Washington in retirement</li>
      <li>
        People who live in border communities, such as Idaho and Oregon, but
        work in Washington state
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The <em>maximum lifetime benefits</em> under the WA Cares Fund are
      $36,500. Being fully vested in the program will not occur until after 10
      years. Without vesting, you will not be entitled to benefits in
      retirement, despite having paid into the tax.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the mandated state plan works for you, there is no need to take any
      further action. However, if you wish to explore an alternative plan,
      here's how the WSMA can help:
    </p>

    <h4>Step one</h4>
    <p>
      To pursue the purchase of a <strong>minimum plan</strong> allowed in order
      to seek an exemption, do the following:
    </p>
    <p>
      First, you need to provide both personal information and medical
      information (such as medications, past hospitalizations, surgeries, and
      other cardiac, cancer, orthopedic, and other treatments) by filling out
      the following secure online questionnaire. Plan on 20 minutes to complete
      this information. Note: This is NOT an application, simply a secure method
      of gathering information necessary to assess rates and insurability. After
      completion, you will be prompted by email to schedule a time with a
      long-term care specialist from WSMA's trusted partner
      <a href="https://www.wolfltc.com">Wolf & Associates</a> to discuss plan
      options.
    </p>
    <p>
      To get quotes on <strong>comprehensive coverage</strong> based on your
      and/or your family's needs, do the following:

    <h4>Step two</h4>
    <p>
      Once you complete either form you will be emailed a booking link to
      schedule a meeting with a long-term care specialist who will assist you.
      You will want to book expeditiously as the window to act is limited.
