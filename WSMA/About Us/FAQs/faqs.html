      <p>
         <strong>What does the WSMA do?</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
         We are a private, non-profit membership organization for physicians, physician assistants, resident physicians and medical students. We are
         funded by membership dues, not by the state. We work on behalf of our members and their patients to provide educational seminars, advocacy
         efforts, lobbying and other services.
      </p>

      <p>
         <strong> Where are you located?</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
         The WSMA has two offices, downtown Seattle and Olympia.

         <a href="mailto:membership@wsma.org">membership@wsma.org</a>, for assistance if the physician is a WSMA member.
      </p>

      <p>
         <strong> How can I obtain a referral for a physician of a particular specialty?</strong>
      </p>

         <a href="[@]WSMA/About/Partner_Organizations/County_Medical_Societies/County_Medical_Societies.aspx">local county medical society</a>.
      </p>
