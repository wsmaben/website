<h1>Uniform Statewide Credentialing Requirement for Medical and Physician Assistant Students</h1>
<p>
The WSMA supports establishing uniformly accepted statewide credentialing and onboarding processes for medical and physician assistant students from Washington state-based medical schools to reduce the burden of repetitive documentation and processing time/costs for medical students, medical and physician assistant schools, and health care organizations within Washington state (Res B-21, A-19)
</p>
<p>
The WSMA supports a statewide effort to urgently align institutional requirements such that every health care entity in Washington state would accept the same attestation. (Res B-21, A-19)
</p>
<p>
The WSMA supports the state using a central electronic database (e.g. CastleBranch) rather than creating a Washington-specific database, that will meet criteria for student privacy protection under law (FERPA) (Res B-21, A-19)
