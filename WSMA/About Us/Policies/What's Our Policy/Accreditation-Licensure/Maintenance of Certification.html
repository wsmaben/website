<h1>Maintenance of Certification</h1>
<p>
The WSMA supports AMA policy which opposes maintenance of certification as a requirement for licensure. (Res B-3, A-12)
</p>

<p>
The WSMA recognizes that the recertification requirements of maintenance of certification are costly, time consuming and disruptive of physician time for patient care, while lacking any proof of improving patient care. (Res B-9, A-14)
</p>

<p>
The WSMA opposes any efforts to mandate maintenance of certification as a condition for medical licensure, hospital staff privileges, reimbursement from third-party insurance parties, malpractice coverage and as a requirement for physician employment. (Res B-9, A-14)
</p>

<p>
The WSMA advocates that a state licensure entity choosing to not re-certify in an ABMS specialty shall not limit the freedom of a licensed physician to practice in Washington state. (Res B-9, A-14)
</p>

<p>
The WSMA opposes mandatory, secured recertifying examinations by the American Board of Medical Specialties or other certifying organizations as part of the recertification process for all those specialties that still require a secure, high-stakes recertification examination. (Res B-6, A-16)
</p>

<p>
The WSM supports legislation and policies that prevent Maintenance of Certification from being used as a condition of licensure, reimbursement employment or hospital admitting privileges. (Res B-6, A-16)
