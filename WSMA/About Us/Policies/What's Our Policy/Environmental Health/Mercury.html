<h1>Mercury</h1>
<p>
The WSMA does not oppose the therapeutic use of selected beneficial mercury-containing medical products. The WSMA encourages physicians and hospitals to phase out the purchase and use of mercury-containing products where alternatives are possible. The WSMA urges medical product suppliers to continue to develop, produce, and market appropriate, cost-competitive, environmentally protective and effective mercury-free replacements. The WSMA calls upon health care professionals to encourage the institutions with which they are associated to adopt policies that will lead toward the eventual elimination of mercury containing products where effective alternatives are available.
