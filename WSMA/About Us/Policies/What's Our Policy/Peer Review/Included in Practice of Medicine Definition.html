<h1>Included in Practice of Medicine Definition</h1> 
<p>
The WSMA believes peer review should be included in the Washington statutory definition of the practice of medicine, and that peer review participation should be justly compensated. The WSMA believes insurance carriers that provide professional liability insurance to physicians should expand the scope of coverage to include participation in peer review. (Res 2, B-89) (Reaffirmed A-17)
