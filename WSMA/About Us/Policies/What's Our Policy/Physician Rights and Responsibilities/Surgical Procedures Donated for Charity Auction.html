<h1>Surgical Procedures Donated for Charity Auction</h1>
<p>
The decision to perform any surgical procedure should be made only after an appropriate examination of the patient and a consultation regarding the procedure's risks and benefits. Auctioning surgical procedures may create unrealistic expectations for patients who are not appropriate candidates for the procedure. The auctioning of surgical procedures may place the physician in a difficult position to objectively assess whether the patient who won the auction is an appropriate candidate for the auctioned procedure. Therefore, it is inappropriate and unethical for physicians to offer or provide a surgical procedure or significant medical intervention as an auction prize (for charitable or commercial purposes). (JC Rpt A, A-01) (Amended A-17)
