      <h1>Professional Corporations</h1>
      <p>
         The WSMA believes it is ethically permissible for physicians to form professional corporations. The ethical principles for the medical
         practice conducted under the form of a professional service corporation are exactly the same as for the individual physicians. The
         professional service corporation and each physician member of the professional service corporation should observe the Principles of Medical
         Ethics. (JC 9.11-87) (Reaffirmed A-17)
