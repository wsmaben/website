<h1>Utilization and Cost, Policies Related to</h1>
<p>
The WSMA actively and strongly opposes efforts by private payers, hospitals, Congress, state legislatures, and the Administration to impose policies designed to control utilization and costs of medical services unless those policies can be proven to achieve cost savings and improve quality while not curtailing appropriate growth and without compromising patient access or quality of care. (Res C-14, A-05) (Reaffirmed A-17)
