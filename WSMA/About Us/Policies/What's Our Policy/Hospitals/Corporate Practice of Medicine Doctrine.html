<h1>"Corporate Practice of Medicine" Doctrine</h1>
<p>
The WSMA supports the clarification of the "Corporate Practice of Medicine" Doctrine in such a way as to:
</p>
	
<ol>
	<li>Preserve independent clinical decision-making; </li>
	
	<li>Provide protection to physicians who bring to light quality of care concerns arising out of an employment situation; </li>
	
	<li>Prohibit non-compete clauses in physician-hospital employment contracts;</li>
	
	<li>Require that hospitals and employed physicians be insured for professional negligence separately and that physicians be allowed to select their own carrier;</li>
	
	<li>Require that medical staff and clinical privileges be considered separately from employment considerations; </li>
	
	<li>That physicians be allowed to own hospitals and ambulatory care centers; and,</li>
	
	<li>That closed medical staff policies be prohibited within any hospital facility in Washington State; assuming the provider meets that hospital's medical staff requirements.</li>
</ol>
