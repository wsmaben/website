<h1>Billing for Housestaff Services</h1>
<p>
The WSMA affirms that when a physician assumes responsibility for the services rendered to a patient by a physician housestaff, the physician may ethically bill the patient for services which were performed under the physician's personal direction and supervision. (JC 4.03-87) (Reaffirmed A-17)
