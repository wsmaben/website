<h1>Assessments, Compulsory</h1>
<p>
The WSMA believes the hospital management does not have the privilege to make compulsory assessments of members of the medical staff for building funds or to demand an audit of staff members' personal financial records as a requisite for staff appointment. Compulsory assessments are not in the best traditions of ethical practice. (JC 4.02-87) (Reaffirmed A-17)
