<h1>Health Facility Ownership by Physician</h1>
<p>
The WSMA believes a physician may own or have a financial interest in a for-profit health facility, nursing home, or other health facility, such as a free-standing surgical center or emergency clinic. However, the physician has an affirmative ethical obligation to disclose his/her ownership of a health facility to his/her patient, prior to admission or utilization. (JC 4.04-87) (Reaffirmed A-17)
