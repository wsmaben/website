<h1>Medical Staff</h1>
<p>
The WSMA believes the organized medical staff is an integral part of the hospital structure. The organized medical staff performs essential hospital functions even though it may often consist primarily of independent practicing physicians who are not hospital employees. The WSMA endorses that members of the organized medical staff may choose to act as a group for the purpose of communicating and dealing with the governing board and others with respect to matters that concern the interest of the organized medical staff and its members. This is ethical so long as there is no adverse interference with patient care or violation of applicable laws. (JC 4.05-87) (Reaffirmed A-17)

<p>
The WSMA is opposed to the establishment of closed medical staff policies by any hospital in Washington State. (Res 4, B-86) (Reaffirmed A-17)
