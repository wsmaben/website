<h1>Physician Role in</h1>
<p>
The WSMA believes that the rules and conditions governing amateur and professional contact sports such as football and hockey, and the extent to which the risks of bodily injury shall be acceptable to society, require informed decision-making in which the medical profession has an essential role. (Reaffirmed A-17) 
</p>

<p>
The WSMA believes the professional responsibility of the physician who serves in a medical capacity at an athletic contest or sporting event is to protect the health and safety of the contestants. The desire of spectators, promoters of the event or even the injured athlete that he/she should not be removed from the contest should not be controlling. (JC 3.06-87) (Reaffirmed A-17)
