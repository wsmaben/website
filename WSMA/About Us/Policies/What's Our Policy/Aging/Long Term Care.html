<h1>Long-Term Care</h1>
<p>
The WSMA believes private funding sources, such as private insurance, must be integrated into public funding for long-term care. The WSMA supports the collection of data on the long-term care patient in order to develop creative alternatives to nursing home care. (Res 17, 26, A-88) (Reaffirmed A-17)
</p>

<p>
The WSMA is committed to educating the public to better understand the cost of quality health care, nursing home costs, and to change existing attitudes regarding long term care, by encouraging such options as home care, chore services, and the Community Options Program Entry System (COPES), to give the elderly assisted living in a less regimented, institutionalized environment.
