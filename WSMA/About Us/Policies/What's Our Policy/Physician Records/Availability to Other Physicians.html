<h1>Availability to Other Physicians</h1>
<p>
The WSMA believes the interest of the patient is paramount in the practice of medicine, and everything that can reasonably and lawfully be done to serve that interest must be done by all physicians who have served or are serving the patient. A physician who formerly has treated a patient should not refuse for any reason to make his/her records of that patient promptly available on request to another physician presently treating the patient. Proper authorization for the use of records must be granted by the patient. Medical reports should not be withheld because of an unpaid bill for medical services. (JC 7.01-87) (Reaffirmed A-17)
