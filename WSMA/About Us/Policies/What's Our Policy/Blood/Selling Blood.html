<p>
The WSMA supports working with the Department of Social and Health Services to eliminate the requirement of welfare recipients to complete a questionnaire stating if they sell blood in order to determine whether the applicant is eligible for food stamps or other welfare benefits. (Res 14, C 85) (Reaffirmed A-17)
