<h1>Education</h1>
<p>
As education is one of the most important means of AIDS prevention, the WSMA encourages physicians to be an educational resource to assist parents in educating their children about AIDS and AIDS prevention. The WSMA recognizes the increasing numbers of AIDS cases occurring in women and children, and emphasizes the need for stronger prevention and research efforts, as well as the provision of care and services for children born to HIV positive mothers. (EC Rpt G, A-91; Res 21, A-88) (Reaffirmed A-17)

<p>
The WSMA encourages the adequate education of its members and other appropriate health care providers on the utility of routine screening of all patients for risk behaviors for HIV/AIDS and other STDs, on the signs and symptoms of HIV disease, appropriate standards for the management of HIV disease and on appropriate messages designed to effect risk reduction among those with HIV and those not yet infected. The WSMA encourages such educational offerings to become a standard part of continuing medical education. (EC Rpt A, A-96) (Reaffirmed A-17)
