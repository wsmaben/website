<h1>Confidentiality</h1>
<p>
The WSMA believes physicians have an ethical and legal obligation to respect the rights of privacy and confidentiality of HIV-positive individuals, while allowing for appropriate transmission of information among health care providers when caring for the individual. The exchange of medical information relating to sexually transmitted diseases (HIV included) should remain confidential except when in conformation with confidentiality regulation (WAC 248-100-0016). (Res 28, B-89; Res 9, A-90; Res 35, A-90; Res 37, A-90; JC 2.18-87) (Reaffirmed A-17)
