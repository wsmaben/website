<h1>Imprint Coding/Labeling</h1>
<p>
The WSMA strongly supports the imprinting of solid medication forms, generic or trademark prescription, including over-the-counter preparations. The WSMA also encourages improving the labeling of vials used in medical practice. (Res 35, C-87; Res 14, C-90) (Reaffirmed A-17)
</p>

<p>
The WSMA believes symbols and logotypes should not be used on drug imprint codes. (Res A-1, A-00) (Reaffirmed A-17)
