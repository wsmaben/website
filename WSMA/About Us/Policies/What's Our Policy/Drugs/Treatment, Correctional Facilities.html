<h1>Treatment, Correctional Facilities</h1>
<p>
The WSMA, in partnership with organizations such as the Washington Academy of Family Physicians, shall advocate for legislation, standards, policies and funding that increase access to evidence-based treatment of substance use and opioid use disorder, including initiation and continuation of opioid-agonist therapy, in correctional facilities within Washington state. (Res B-10 A-17) 
</p>

<p>
The WSMA supports legislation, standards, policies and funding that encourage correctional facilities within Washington state to work in ongoing collaboration with addiction treatment providers, case managers, social workers and pharmacies in the communities where patients are released to provide post-incarceration treatment plans for substance use and opioid use disorder, including education, medication for addiction treatment, and medication for preventing overdose deaths (Res B-10 A-17)
</p>

<p>
The WSMA, in its current policy that supports the use of methadone maintenance, also supports evidence-based medication assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid dependency use disorder to include buprenorphine in correctional facilities (Res B-10 A-17)
