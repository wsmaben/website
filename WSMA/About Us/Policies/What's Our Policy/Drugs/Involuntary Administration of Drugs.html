<h1>Involuntary Administration of Drugs</h1>
<p>
The WSMA believes a physician may administer certain medication to certain patients with psychological illnesses without their consent in order to protect them from harming themselves or others. The WSMA does not believe that the administration of involuntary medication for the mentally ill requires judicial review, as judicial hearings divert scarce resources from the care and treatment of the mentally ill. (Res 44, C-90) (Reaffirmed A-17)
