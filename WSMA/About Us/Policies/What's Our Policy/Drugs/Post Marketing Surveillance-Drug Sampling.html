<h1>Post Marketing Surveillance/Drug Sampling</h1>
<p>
The WSMA strongly endorses physicians' participation in post-marketing surveillance, including working with the State Department of Health to seek grant or contract funds to assure the surveillance program increases. The WSMA opposes any "novel" legislation or regulatory action that would restrict the reasonable conduct of drug sampling of licensed practitioners. (Res 37, C 87; Res 5, A-90) (Reaffirmed A-17)
