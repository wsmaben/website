<h1>Condom Education and Access for Teens</h1>
<p>
The WSMA urges families, schools, the media and others in positions of authority to teach the value of abstinence from premature sex through programs that teach sexual abstinence, self-discipline and responsible attitudes toward sexuality, together with refusal skills to cope with peer pressure and endorses comprehensive education which reduces the risks for unwanted pregnancy and sexually-transmitted disease, including the proper use of condoms for all who are sexually active.
