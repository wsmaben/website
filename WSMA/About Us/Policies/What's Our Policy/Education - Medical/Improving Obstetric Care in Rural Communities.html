         education through hospital partnerships, and rural family medicine residency programs. (B-6, A-20)
      </p>
      <p>
         The WSMA support the formation of new obstetric fellowships, and expansion of current obstetric fellowships in Washington State
         (B-6, A-20)
      </p>

      <p>
         The WSMA support the concept that members engaged in obstetrical practice should have affordable access, both financially and in
         their time allocation, to the CME that is needed to perform their obstetric duties well. (B-6, A-20)
