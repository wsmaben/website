<h1>Risks to Health Care Team</h1>

<p>
The WSMA recognizes that the decision to perform an invasive procedure which has the potential of placing the health care team at risk deserves and requires consideration of the medical necessity of the procedure and the benefit to the patient. The WSMA favors policies or standards which consider the risk to the health care team involved with invasive procedures. (Res 35, A-90) (Reaffirmed A-17)
