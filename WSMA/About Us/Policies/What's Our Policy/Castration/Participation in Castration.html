<h1>Participation in Castration</h1>
<p>
The WSMA believes it is not appropriate for physicians to participate in the castration of sex offenders until the efficacy of such treatment is proven, or unless the physician is participating in a clinical investigation and has obtained the patient's consent and is following the guidelines for such study. (JC Rpt A, A-90) (Reaffirmed A-17)
