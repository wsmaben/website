<h1>Medical Directors</h1>
	
<p>
The WSMA supports requiring medical directors of health plans to have a valid license to practice medicine in the state of Washington. The WSMA also believes that decisions regarding clinical medicine made by medical directors of health plans should be considered the practice of medicine and therefore subject to the surveillance and constraints of the Washington Medical Commission.
