<h1>Accountability</h1>
<p>
The WSMA believes that the Washington Medical Commission should be recognized by both the public and by the profession, and by related industries, as having authority and the responsibility to pass judgments about medical decisions made or implemented by medical directors or analogous physicians throughout the state of Washington. (Res C-6, A-98) (Reaffirmed A-17)
