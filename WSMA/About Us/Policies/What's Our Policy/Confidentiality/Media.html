The WSMA believes that a physician should not discuss a patient's medical condition, disease, or illness with the press without the patient's authorization, as provided for in the HIPAA privacy rule and related regulations. In order to aid physicians in understanding what information is in the public domain and can be made available without the patient's consent, the WSMA has established guidelines detailed in the 1987 Judicial Council Opinions, 5.05, but in all cases the physician's actions must be in compliance with the HIPAA privacy rule and related regulations. (JC 5.04,.05-87) (Amended A-17)
