<h1>Conversion to For-profit Status</h1>
<p>
The WSMA supports a policy that any public assets derived through the not-for-profit status of health insurers, health service contractors and HMOs that become available through the conversion from a not-for-profit to a for-profit status be retained in similar not-for-profit organizations or in foundations supporting the health of the community. (Res C-6, A-00) (Reaffirmed A-17)
