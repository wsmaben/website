<h1>Dispute Resolution</h1>
<p>
The WSMA believes health plan contracts should include provisions that would: 1) permit physicians to mandate mediation and binding arbitration to resolve disputes with carriers, but would also ensure that physicians and non-physician providers have access to the court system in cases where the transactions costs of mediation and arbitration are not suitable, where substantial issues of law reform are present or in other appropriate cases; and, 2) define issues subject to arbitration in such cases as all disputes, including termination without cause by carriers, for reasons that are inappropriate. (Res C-7, A-99) (Reaffirmed A-17)
