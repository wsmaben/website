<h1>Premium Payment Cycles</h1>
<p>
The WSMA supports changes in health plan premium payment cycles to require employers to pay premiums by the 15th of the month preceding the month for which coverage is to be provided so that current month eligibility can be determined. (Res B-3, A-01) (Reaffirmed A-17)
