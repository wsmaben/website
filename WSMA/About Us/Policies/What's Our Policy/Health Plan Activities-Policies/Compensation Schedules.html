<h1>Compensation Schedules</h1>
<p>
The WSMA believes health plans should include an attachment in physician and non-physician provider contracts entitled, "Compensation Schedule" that provides a comprehensive compensation schedule for each plan or company product which clearly delineates the services covered, reimbursement for each service, and penalty charges for failure to provide a compensation schedule, so that they can be negotiated, renewed, or terminated individually. (Reaffirmed A-19)
