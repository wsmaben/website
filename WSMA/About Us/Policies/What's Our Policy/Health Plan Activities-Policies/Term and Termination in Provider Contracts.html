<h1>Term and Termination in Provider Contracts</h1>
<p>
The WSMA believes health plan provider agreements should provide that: 1) the non-compensation terms of any agreement should be binding throughout the relationship of the parties; 2) a provider be given a reason in writing when a plan exercises the "without cause" clause in a contract; 3) the compensation terms for each plan or product should be re-negotiated annually and reviewed or rejected individually; and, 4) whenever a contract is terminated, a reason for such termination must be stated in writing. (Res C-14, A-99) (Reaffirmed A-17)
</p>

<p>
The WSMA believes the reasons for termination of health plan provider agreements should be given, whether at the end of the agreement's term or otherwise. (Res C-14, A-99) (Reaffirmed A-17)
