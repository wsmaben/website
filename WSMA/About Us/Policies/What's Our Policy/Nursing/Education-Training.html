<h1>Education/Training</h1>
<p>
The WSMA encourages and supports the training of more nursing personnel, with appropriate remuneration. The WSMA endorses state rather than federal licensing of all health care practitioners. The WSMA believes that the education and training of nursing personnel be under the supervision of nurses, in consultation with other health care professionals where appropriate. (Res 14, D-88) (Reaffirmed A-17)
