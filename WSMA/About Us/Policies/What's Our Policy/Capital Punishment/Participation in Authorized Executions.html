<h1>Participation in Authorized Executions</h1>
<p>
The WSMA supports the physician as a member of a profession dedicated to the preservation of life when there is a hope of doing so. Therefore, participation in a legally authorized execution is discouraged by the WSMA. (JC 2.06-87) (Reaffirmed A-17)
