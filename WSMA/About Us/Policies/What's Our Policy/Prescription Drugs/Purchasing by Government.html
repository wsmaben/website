<h1>Purchasing by Government</h1>
<p>
The WSMA will not interfere in the government's prudent purchasing strategies of prescription drugs for its own specific programs unless the proposals adversely affect appropriate patient care (Therapeutic Substitution), interfere with the physician and patient relationship (Disease Management), or cause undue administrative burden on physician practices (Rebates with Prior Authorization). (EC 9/00) (Reaffirmed A-17)
