      <h1>Reform - General</h1>
      <p>
         The WSMA reaffirms its negotiating principles of proportional linkage of access and cost control in its dealings related to reform
         issues. (EC Rpt C, A-92) (Reaffirmed A-17)
      </p>

      <p>
         The ability of health care organizations to work together, without fear of anti-trust actions, in the interest of economics of
         scale and organizational capacity, to deliver efficient care. (Reaffirmed A-17)
      </p>

      <p>
         Not ruling out the possibility of a single payer system, either governmental or private (i.e. through a bidding process), to
         provide the basic health care benefits. (Reaffirmed A-17)
      </p>

      <p>
         An adequate supply and distribution of primary care physicians. This should be accomplished by increasing funding to primary care
         training and assistance programs and by removing financial disincentives to primary care. (Reaffirmed A-17)
      </p>

      <p>
         Collective bargaining by physicians within the "system" with respect to payment and working conditions if payment schedules are
         imposed along with defined practice patterns. (Res 1, S-91) (Reaffirmed A-17)
      </p>

      <p>
         The WSMA will continue to support legislation requiring all citizens of the state of Washington to have health insurance coverage
         for a generally accepted "basic" package of benefits with such a mandate coupled with appropriate incentives to encourage citizens
         to gain coverage and be "needs tested" so that society ensures access to coverage for low income citizens. (BT Rpt J, A-01; EC Rpt
         F, A-02) (Reaffirmed A-17)
