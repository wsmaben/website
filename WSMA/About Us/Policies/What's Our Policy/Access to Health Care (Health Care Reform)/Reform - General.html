<h1>Reform - General</h1>
<p>

</p>

<p>
The ability of health care organizations to work together, without fear of anti-trust actions, in the interest of economics of scale and organizational capacity, to deliver efficient care. (Reaffirmed A-17)
</p>

<p>
Not ruling out the possibility of a single payer system, either governmental or private (i.e. through a bidding process), to provide the basic health care benefits. (Reaffirmed A-17)
</p>

<p>
An adequate supply and distribution of primary care physicians. This should be accomplished by increasing funding to primary care training and assistance programs and by removing financial disincentives to primary care. (Reaffirmed A-17)

<p>
The WSMA will continue to support legislation requiring all citizens of the state of Washington to have health insurance coverage for a generally accepted "basic" package of benefits with such a mandate coupled with appropriate incentives to encourage citizens to gain coverage and be "needs tested" so that society ensures access to coverage for low income citizens. (BT Rpt J, A-01; EC Rpt F, A-02) (Reaffirmed A-17)
