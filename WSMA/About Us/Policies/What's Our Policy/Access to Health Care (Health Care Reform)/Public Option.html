<h1>Public Option</h1>
<p>
The WSMA supports a public option for Washington state (offering for purchase by all Washington residents the same coverage as that offered to Washington state employees through the Public Employees Benefit Board and the School Employees Benefits Board, with subsidies available to those who cannot afford the premium cost and who do not qualify for Medicaid), but not to the exclusion of other potential models. (Res C-4, A-18)
