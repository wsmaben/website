<h1>Regulation</h1>
<p>
The WSMA believes that the most dangerous tobacco products, such as cigarettes, should be regulated with the utmost stringency, and that these products should be labeled with the most obvious and urgent warnings. (Res C-8, A-07) (Reaffirmed A-18)
</p>

<p>
The WSMA supports a prohibition on the sale of tobacco products from a business or facility that also operates a health clinic on the same premises. (Res C-2, A-08)
