<h1>Legislation</h1>
<p>
The WSMA endorses legislation that restricts youth exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, restricts the advertising and promotion of tobacco products to youth, bans vending machines and free sampling of tobacco products, and bans illegal sales of tobacco products to minors. In addition, the WSMA endorses legislation that will dedicate long-term funding for a comprehensive statewide tobacco prevention and education program directed toward our youth.
