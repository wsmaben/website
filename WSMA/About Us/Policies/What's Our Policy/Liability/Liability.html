<h1>Liability</h1>
<p>
The WSMA supports continued study of the relationship between compliance with professional "practice parameters" or "practice guidelines" with relief from professional liability, but that direct support for this concept should be withheld until such time as the relationship has been proven, through study and research, to be efficacious and that conclusive evidence as to their effectiveness is available. (EC Rpt M, A-94) (Reaffirmed A-17)
