<h1>Liability Reform</h1>
<p>
In strategizing its legislative efforts, the WSMA will seek opportunities to link liability reform issues with other various issues, including access to care, (i.e. liability reform and prenatal care). (Reaffirmed A-17)
</p>

<p>
The WSMA supports continued aggressive physician and public education and communications campaigns on tort reform, working with the Liability Reform Coalition to the extent possible, and working independently as necessary to mobilize grassroots public opinion on the benefits derived from reform efforts and the need for additional reform. (EC Rpt B, A-89) (Reaffirmed A-17)
</p>
	
<p>
The WSMA resolved that the Liability Reform Coalition continue to work with the Washington section of ACOG and the Washington State Obstetrical Association and the WAFP to improve the access to prenatal care for the state's Medicaid populations. (EC Rpt B, A-88) (Amended A-17)
