<h1>No Codes</h1>
<p>
The WSMA believes the use of CPR in some instances can be contrary to the best interests of the patient. Therefore, the WSMA believes that should the physician consider "code" harmful to the patient's best interest, it is necessary that the physician inform the charge nurse and sign the nurse's order card, or write the order as any other order. The physician's decision shall be guided by the consent of the patient, the patient's family or guardian. (JC 2.14.2-87) (Reaffirmed A-17)
</p>

<p>
The WSMA supports the enablement of basic and/or advanced life support units responding to an out-of-hospital emergency to honor a valid do-not-resuscitate directive. (Res 7, C-91) (Reaffirmed A-17)
