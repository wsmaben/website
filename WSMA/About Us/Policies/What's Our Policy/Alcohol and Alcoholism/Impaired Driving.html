The WSMA supports policies aimed at reducing repeat impaired driving that could include: 
</p>


<ul>
	<li>Monitoring installation and use of mandatory ignition interlock devices for all convicted DUI offenders with the following actions that the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration has found to reduce impaired driving: 1) incentives for early installation, 2) eliminate eligibility of repeat offenders for diversion programs, 3) coordination across all agencies involved in interlocks, 4) implement uniformly across the state, 5) strong, swift penalties for violations of use, and 6) ongoing evaluation and publication of programs' effectiveness for improving interlock use; </li>
 
	<li>Requiring mandatory substance abuse assessment and treatment for all convicted DUI offenders; </li>
 
	<li>Recommending blood toxicology testing at the accident scene by qualified officers for all traffic crashes resulting in fatalities or serious injury; </li>
