<h1>Lien Laws</h1>
<p>
The WSMA believes it is not improper for a physician to use a physicians' lien law as a means of assuring payment of his/her fee, provided his/her fee is fixed in amount and not contingent on the amount of settlement of the patient's claim against a third party. (JC 8.09-87) (Reaffirmed A-17)
