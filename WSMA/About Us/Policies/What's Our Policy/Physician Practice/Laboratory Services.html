<h1>Laboratory Services</h1>
<p>
The WSMA believes that a physician should not misrepresent the laboratory services performed and supervised by a non-physician as the physician's professional services. The professional relationship between the laboratory and the physician should be clear and not misleading. (Reaffirmed A-17)
</p>

<p>
The WSMA believes it is unethical for two or more physicians to secretly split or share the fees that have been given by a patient supposedly as reimbursement for the service of one person alone. When it is more practical for the physician to include the laboratory charge in his/her own statement, the physician's bill to the patient should indicate the charges apart from the charges for his/her own professional services. (JC 8.08-87) (Amended A-17)
