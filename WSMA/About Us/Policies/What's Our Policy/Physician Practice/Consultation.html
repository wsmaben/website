<h1>Consultation</h1>
<p>
The WSMA believes that physicians should obtain consultation whenever they believe that it would be helpful in the care of the patient or when requested by the patient or the patient's representative. When a patient is referred to a consultant, the referring physician should provide a history of the case and such other information as the consultant may need, and the consultant should advise the referring physician of the results of the consultant's examination and recommendations relating to the management of the case as soon as possible. A physician selected by a patient for the purpose of obtaining a second opinion on an elective procedure is not obligated to advise the patient's regular physician of the findings or recommendations unless requested by the patient. (JC 8.03-87; JC Rpt C, A-93) (Reaffirmed A-17)
