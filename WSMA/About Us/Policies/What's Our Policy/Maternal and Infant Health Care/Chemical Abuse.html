<h1>Chemical Abuse</h1>
<p>
The WSMA is committed to actively participating in addressing the increasing incidence of drug-addicted newborns by interacting with substance abuse contractors, the DSHS Prenatal Care Program, and other state agencies and community groups to identify: 1) the needs of drug-addicted parents and babies; 2) the means by which to meet those needs; and 3) ways of educating the community about available resources. (EC Rpt N, A-88) (Amended A-17)
</p>
<p>
The WSMA is committed to working with state agencies, community groups and the legislature to address the chemical abuse of infants by developing non-punitive treatment for mothers and babies through innovative pilot programs of prevention, treatment, counseling, and care both during pregnancy and following birth. (EC Rpt H, A-90) (Reaffirmed A-17)
