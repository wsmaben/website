<h1>Mammography</h1>
<p>
The WSMA encourages the Washington State Hospital Association and any local cancer surveillance unit or hospital tumor registry to release to those interested radiologists, on a reason-to-know basis, the names of breast cancer patients who have had mammography performed at that radiologist's facilities. (Res 43, B-90) (Reaffirmed A-17)
</p>

<p>
In the absence of general medical consensus regarding the appropriateness of breast density notification, the WSMA supports the inclusion of clinically appropriate breast tissue density information in the mammography report and education of patients about the clinical relevance of such information, but opposes legislative and regulatory mandates for direct notification to patients regarding breast tissue density. (Res A-10, A-14)
