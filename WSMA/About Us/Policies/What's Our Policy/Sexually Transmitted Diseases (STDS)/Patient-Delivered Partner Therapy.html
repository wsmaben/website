<h1>Patient-Delivered Partner Therapy</h1>
<p>
The WSMA endorses the current Washington State Department of Health recommendations regarding patient-delivered partner therapy (PDPT): "the provider should inform the patient that it would be best to have all partners exposed during the previous 60 days come into a clinic for examination, testing and treatment. However, if treatment is not otherwise assured, the patient should be provided antibiotics for their partners." (Res A-2, A-04) (Reaffirmed A-17)
</p>

<p>
The WSMA encourages physicians in Washington state to offer the option of PDPT to appropriate patients when treating them for gonorrhea or chlamydial infection if treatment of their sex partners is not otherwise assured. (Res A-2, A-04) (Reaffirmed A-17)
