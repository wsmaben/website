<h1>Chlamydia Screening</h1>
<p>
The WSMA supports the current Washington State Department of Health recommendations regarding chlamydia screening: "the provider should screen all sexually active women aged 25 years and younger at least annually and assure adequate treatment of all positives and their contacts;" (Res A-5, A-04) (Reaffirmed A-17)
</p>

<p>
The WSMA recommends that providers offer screening to all pregnant women for chlamydia at the first prenatal visit, and should repeat a chlamydia screening test during the third trimester of pregnancy if the pregnant patient is under age 25, or has a new sex partner, or has more than one sex partner. (Res A-5, A-04) (Reaffirmed A-17)
</p>

<p>
The WSMA recommends that providers offer rescreening of all women with chlamydial infections 3-4 months after treatment, and whenever they next present for care within the following 12 months regardless of whether the woman believes that her sex partners were treated. (Res A-5, A-04) (Reaffirmed A-17)
