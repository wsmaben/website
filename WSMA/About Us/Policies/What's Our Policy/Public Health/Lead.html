<h1>Lead</h1>
<p>
The WSMA supports state and federal policy changes that reduce and eliminate harmful exposures to lead in toys and other children's products, including urging policies that set standards for lead in toys and other children's products at an American Academy of Pediatrics maximum of 40 ppm. (Res C-5, A-08) 
</p>

<p>
The WSMA advocates for measures by physicians and public health authorities to identify, treat, and eliminate sources of childhood lead poisoning in Washington state, including:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Adopting the federal and Washington State Department of Health reference level of >5 &mu;g/dL as an unacceptable level of lead in children at 12 and 24 months.</li>
	<li>Increasing funding for lead blood testing in physicians' offices and medical centers caring for pediatric patients.</li>
	<li>Standardizing reporting of lead test results to the Washington State Department of Health through a secure, electronic reporting system.</li>
	<li>Standardizing reporting and data collection and follow-up of lead testing results through state and local public health offices.</li>
	<li>Working with the Washington State Health Care Authority to ensure all health care providers fulfill the federal obligation to test all Medicaid-eligible children at 12 and 24 months of age.</li>
	<li>Supporting a mandate that all pre-1978 rental housing units statewide be lead safe as per the existing Washington State Department of Ecology's chemical action plan.</li>
	<li>Increasing local and state funding for treatment and case management of children with lead poisoning.</li>
	<li>Educating health care providers and the public about the importance of primary prevention of lead poisoning (removing sources) and secondary prevention (risk assessment questions and testing for blood lead as indicated per risk assessment).</li>
</ol>
