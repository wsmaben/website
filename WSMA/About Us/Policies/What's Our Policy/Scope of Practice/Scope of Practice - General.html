<h1>Scope of Practice</h1>
<p>
The WSMA opposes efforts for non-physician practitioners to expand the scope of their practice to include additional services currently performed by physicians, in the absence of either commensurate education and supervised training requirements, or a demonstrable and compelling societal need. (Res C-20, A-19)
