<h1>Physical Therapists</h1>
<p>
The WSMA supports the modification of the Physical Therapist Act to include provisions holding physical therapists to the same standard of care as physicians for the services they provide, to allow physicians to hire physical therapist assistants or allow physician assistants to perform similar services, to include reverse mandated provider provisions and to prevent physical therapists from referring to themselves as providers of sports medicine. (BT 1/91) (Reaffirmed A-17)
