<h1>Referral of Patients</h1>
<p>
The WSMA supports the freedom of choice of physicians to refer their patients to the physician practice or hospital that they think is most able to provide the best medical care. (Res B-5, A-16)
</p>
	
<p>
The WSMA believes that a physician may refer a patient for diagnostic or therapeutic services to another provider whenever he/she believes that this may benefit the patient. As in the case of referrals to physician-specialists, referrals to limited practitioners should be based on their individual competence and ability to perform the services needed by the patient. (JC 3.04-87) (Reaffirmed A-17)
