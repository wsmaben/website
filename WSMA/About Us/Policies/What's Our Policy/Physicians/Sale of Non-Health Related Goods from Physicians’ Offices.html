      <h1>Sale of Non-Health Related Goods from Physicians' Offices</h1>
      <p>The WSMA has established the following guidelines regarding the sale of non-health related goods from a physicians' office:</p>

      <ol type="a">
         <li>Physicians should not sell non-health-related goods from their offices or other treatment settings, with the exception noted below.</li>

         <li>
            Physicians may sell low-cost non-prescription goods from their offices for the profit of community organizations, provided that a) the
            goods in question are low-cost, b) the physician takes no share in profit from their sale, c) such sales are not a regular part of the
            physician's business, d) sales are conducted in a dignified manner, and e) sales are conducted in such a way as to assure that patients
            are not pressured into making purchases.
         </li>
      </ol>
