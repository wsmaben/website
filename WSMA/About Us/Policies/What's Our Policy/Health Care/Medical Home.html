<h1>Medical Home</h1>
<p>
The WSMA supports the implementation of strategies that promote primary care as described in the following "Core Principles of a Patient-Centered Medical Home" adopted in March 2007 by the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American College of Physicians (ACP) and the American Osteopathic Association (AOA).
</p>


<h1>Core Principles of a Patient-Centered Medical Home</h1>

<p>
<strong>Personal physician</strong> - each patient has an ongoing relationship with a personal physician trained to provide first contact, continuous and comprehensive care
</p>

<p>
<strong>Physician directed medical practice</strong> &ndash; the personal physician leads a team of individuals at the practice level who collectively take responsibility for the ongoing care of patients.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Whole person orientation</strong> &ndash; the personal physician is responsible for providing for all the patient's health care needs or taking responsibility for appropriately arranging care with other qualified professionals. This includes care for all stages of life; acute care; chronic care; preventive services; and end of life care.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Care is coordinated and/or integrated</strong> across all elements of the complex healthcare system including subspecialty care, hospitals, home health agencies, nursing homes as well as the patient's community (e.g., family, public and private community-based services). 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Quality and safety</strong> are hallmarks of the medical home in which practices advocate for their patients to support the attainment of optimal, patient-centered outcomes that are defined by a care planning process driven by a compassionate, robust partnership between physicians, patients, and the patient's family.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Enhanced access</strong> to care is available through systems such as open scheduling, expanded hours and new options for communication between patients, their personal physician, and practice staff.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Payment</strong> appropriately recognizes the added value provided to patients who have a patient-centered medical home.
