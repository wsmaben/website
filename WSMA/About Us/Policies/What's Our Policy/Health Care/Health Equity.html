      <h1>Health Equity</h1>
      <p>
         The WSMA believes that a healthy Washington will require leadership and partnership of businesses, advocacy groups, community
         non-profits, environmental justice organizations, chambers of commerce, religious organizations, labor organizations, educational
         organizations, professional associations and others. (Res B-4, A-13)
      </p>

      <p>
         The WSMA: 1) Supports the goal of addressing social determinants of health; 2) Supports the efforts of community initiated and
         driven action projects, private, non-profit and academic sectors independently and in collaboration with government to achieve
         health equity and eliminate racial/ethnic inequities in Washington; and, 3) Supports reaching out to diverse communities to assist
         them in addressing health inequities (Res B-4, A-13)
