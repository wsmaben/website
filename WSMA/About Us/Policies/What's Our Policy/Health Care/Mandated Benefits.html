<h1>Mandated Benefits</h1>
<p>
The WSMA reaffirms its long-standing policy of opposition to legislative or regulatory mandates of benefits (CPA Rpt F, A-97), except that the Board of Trustees, or the Executive Committee acting between meetings of the board, has the authority to determine when a proposed mandate represents such a clearly overriding social or economic benefit as to warrant an exception to this policy. (EC Rpt M, A 99) (Reaffirmed A-17)
