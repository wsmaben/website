<h1>Reform</h1>
<p>
The WSMA is committed to working with the Department of Social and Health Services, and other concerned groups, such as the advocates of Medicaid beneficiaries, to support reform of the Medicaid program &ndash; including reform of the benefit, payment and delivery structures of the Medicaid program, as well as the relocation of the Division of Medical Assistance within a separate Department of Health &ndash; to increase its responsiveness to the health care needs of those the program is intended to serve.  (Res 3, C-91; EC Rpt P, A-88) (Reaffirmed A-17)

The WSMA advocates changes in the tax structure so that society as a whole bears the burden of cost of care for the economically disadvantaged. (EC Rpt P, A-88) (Reaffirmed A-17)
