<h1>Equal Pay for Equal Work</h1>
<p>
The WSMA supports public policy that allows for the recognition of qualitative distinctions in skill, training and expertise between physicians and other providers of health care. In particular, clarification is needed where public policy mandates third-party coverage for the services of various providers of health care or requires that non-physicians be reimbursed at physician rates. (Res 16, A-89) (Reaffirmed A-17)

<p>
The WSMA is opposed to differential specialty-based fee reimbursement for the same work or differential geographic-based fee reimbursement. (Res 45, B-88; EC 9/91) (Reaffirmed A-17)
