      <h1>Reimbursement</h1>
      <p>
         The WSMA encourages insurance companies and businesses in the state of Washington to provide reimbursement for medical services
         designed to prevent morbidity and mortality. (Res 15, C-88) (Reaffirmed A-17)
      </p>

      <p>
         The WSMA advocates for reimbursement for all professional services, including communication services, provided through physicians’
         practices. (Res B-2, A-00) (Reaffirmed A-17)
      </p>

      <p>
         The WSMA, in order to ensure equitable reimbursement for women and minority-owned practices, and for small practices in general,
         supports legislation that would direct the OIC to study systemic bias in insurance company reimbursement of minority and
         women-owned practices and provide a report that includes recommendations to address the issue in the legislature. (B-16, A-20)
      </p>
      <p>
         The WSMA supports efforts to persuade the legislature to pass a statute requiring insurance companies to reimburse outpatient
         diabetes self-management education and care which could be delivered safely and less expensively than an inpatient setting. (Res
         A-89) (Reaffirmed A-17)
      </p>

      <p>
         The WSMA supports requiring payers to reimburse for diabetes prevention, lifestyle modification programs, and community health
         workers to incentivize early interventions. (Res C-18, A-18)
