<h1>Access</h1>
<p>
The WSMA encourages physicians to assist in the development of school-based and/or school-linked sites of care and work to assure that these activities will complement care provided by their current personal physician so that all adolescents in their communities have access to comprehensive health services. (Res A-1, A-99) (Reaffirmed A-17)
