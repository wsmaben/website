<h1>ADHD</h1>
<p>
The WSMA encourages physicians to utilize standardized diagnostic criteria in making the diagnosis of ADHD, such as the current American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, as part of a comprehensive evaluation of children, adolescents, and adults presenting with attentional or hyperactivity complaints. (CPA Rpt D, A-97) (Amended A-17)
</p>

<p>
The WSMA encourages all relevant residency programs within Washington, and continuing medical education sponsors to expand educational efforts which will increase physician knowledge about ADHD, its treatment, and serious abuse potential of the prescribed medication. (CPA Rpt D, A-97) (Amended A-17)
</p>

<p>
The WSMA encourages the use of individualized therapeutic approaches for children diagnosed with ADHD, which may include pharmacotherapy, psycho-education, behavioral therapy, school-based and other environmental interventions, and psychotherapy as indicated by clinical circumstances and family preferences. (CPA Rpt D, A-97) (Reaffirmed A-17)
</p>

<p>
The WSMA encourages physicians to work with educators to improve their ability to recognize ADHD and appropriately recommend that parents seek medical evaluation of potentially affected children. (CPA Rpt D, A-97) (Reaffirmed A-17)
</p>

<p>
The WSMA advocates the use of state funds as grants to programs which could deliver the non-pharmacologic services for the treatment of ADHD. (CPA Rpt D, A-97) (Reaffirmed A-17)
