<h1>Surgical Assistant's Fee</h1>
<p>
Each physician engaged in the care of the patient is entitled to compensation commensurate with the value of the services they have personally rendered.  However, the WSMA strongly believes the nature of the financial arrangement must be made known to the patient.  (JC 6.12-87) (Reaffirmed A-17)
