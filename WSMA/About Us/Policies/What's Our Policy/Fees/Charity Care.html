<h1>Charity Care</h1>
<p>
The WSMA defines charity care as a medical service provided by a physician who offers time and expertise with no requirement or expectation of monetary reimbursement from the patient or other source and does not include any expectation that physicians must subsidize the cost of providing those services. (Res B-8, A-01) (Reaffirmed A-17)
