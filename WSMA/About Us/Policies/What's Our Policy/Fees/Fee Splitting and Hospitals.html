<h1>Fee Splitting and Hospitals</h1>
<p>
The WSMA is opposed to hospitals charging physicians who utilize their facilities a percentage of the fees which they receive from their patients while being cared for in the hospital. The WSMA feels this would amount to splitting or sharing professional fees with a lay organization which has already levied its regular bill for the services which it legitimately rendered, therefore, it is improper. (JC 6.07-87) (Reaffirmed A-17)
