<h1>Fee Splitting: Purchase of Medical Practice on a Percentage Basis</h1>
<p>
The WSMA believes a physician may pay anything he/she wants to for a medical practice as long as a set price is established, but it is unethical for a physician to pay a percentage of the income of the practice that he/she has purchased as payment for it. (JC 6.06-87) (Reaffirmed A-17)
