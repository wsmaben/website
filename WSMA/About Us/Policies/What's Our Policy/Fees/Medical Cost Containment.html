<h1>Medical Cost Containment</h1>
<p>
The WSMA supports the formation of a physicians' cooperative to provide supplies to physicians at a cost-plus-handling fee, whereby physicians can obtain quality products and maintain some control of their ever-increasing overhead expenses. (Res 46, D-88) (Reaffirmed A-17)
