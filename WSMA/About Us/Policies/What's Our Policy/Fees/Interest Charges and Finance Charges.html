<h1>Interest Charges and Finance Charges</h1>
<p>
The WSMA believes that although harsh or commercial collection practices should be discouraged in the practice of medicine, a physician who has experienced problems with delinquent accounts may properly choose to request that payment be made at the time of treatment, or add interest or other reasonable charges to delinquent accounts. (JC 6.10-87) (Reaffirmed A-17)
