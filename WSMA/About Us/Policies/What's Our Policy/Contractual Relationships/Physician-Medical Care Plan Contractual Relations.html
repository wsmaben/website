<h1>Physician-Medical Care Plan Contractual Relations</h1>
<p>
The WSMA recognizes that under proper legal authority such plans may be established, and a physician may be employed by, or otherwise serve, a medical care plan. In the operation of such plans, physicians should not be subjected to lay interference in professional medical matters, and their primary responsibility should be to the patients they serve. (JC 8.05-87) (Reaffirmed A-17)
