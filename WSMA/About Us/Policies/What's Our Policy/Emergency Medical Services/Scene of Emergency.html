<h1>Scene of Emergency</h1>
<p>
The WSMA supports every effort to enhance cooperation between physicians and paramedical emergency personnel. The WSMA urges all local medical societies to consider a policy regarding this matter, then publish and distribute a card delineating policy for use by local paramedics or individuals who are certified in advanced life support systems.
