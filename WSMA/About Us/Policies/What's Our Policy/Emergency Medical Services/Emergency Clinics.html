<h1>Emergency Clinics</h1>
<p>
The WSMA urges physicians who offer acute care to the public, using the term "emergency" or "urgency" in their clinic titles, to do so only if they are fully equipped and fully staffed to handle life-threatening emergencies while arranging patient transfer to a bona fide hospital emergency facility.
