<h1>Offers of Settlement</h1>
<p>
An offer of settlement procedure should be implemented to permit a party to make a formal offer to another party to settle the lawsuit for a stated amount. If the party to whom the offer is made does not accept the offer and does not better its position at trial, then the party that refused the offer should be required to pay the offering party's reasonable attorneys' fees.
