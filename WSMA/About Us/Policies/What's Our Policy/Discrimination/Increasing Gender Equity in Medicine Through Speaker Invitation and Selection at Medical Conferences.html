<h1>Increasing Gender Equity in Medicine Through Speaker Invitation and Selection at Medical Conferences</h1>
<p>
The WSMA acknowledge the existence of gender inequity in medicine and acknowledge that promoting greater inclusion of female and gender minority speakers at medical conferences can influence gender equity by encouraging female and gender minority medical graduates to choose historically male-dominated specialties. (Res C-8, A-19)
