      <h1>Diversity and Inclusion in the Field of Medicine in Washington State</h1>
      <p>
         The Washington State Medical Association (WSMA) expand its review of demographic data in the organization to include information on
         race/ethnicity and International Medical Graduate status within the organization including its Board of Trustees, Executive Committee and
         staff, report this to members, and take action to reduce any inequities that may be identified above and report these actions to members.
         (B-8, A-20)
      </p>
      <p>
         The WSMA support efforts to enhance diversity in the physician workforce, including engaging in broad-based efforts that involve a wide array
         of partners both within and outside the medical profession. This includes advocating for funding to support the following: (a)
         Pipeline/pathway programs to prepare and motivate members of underrepresented groups to enter medical school; (b) Diversity or minority
         affairs offices at medical schools; (c) Financial aid programs for students from groups that are underrepresented in medicine; and (d)
         Financial support programs to recruit and develop faculty members from underrepresented groups. (B-8, A-20)
      </p>

      <p>
         The WSMA encourage medical schools and residency programs in the state of Washington to review and publicly report data on their diversity in
         terms of race/ethnicity. (B-8, A-20)
