      <h1>Reducing Racism and Discrimination in Law Enforcement</h1>
      <p>WSMA affirms that racism, discrimination and hate crimes are a public health issue. (B-13, A-20)</p>
      <p>
         WSMA supports the adoption and implementation, by Washington’s law enforcement and other entities, of best practices that reduce
         excessive force and discriminatory policing. This may include:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>Creating a reporting system of incidents of excessive force by law enforcement to state health departments</li>
         <li>Evidence based best practices and community partnerships that reduce use of force by law enforcement</li>
         <li>
            Effective law enforcement recruitment, training and retention that encourage safe and non-discriminatory policing practices
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>(B-13, A-20)</p>
