      <h1>Advancing Gender Equity in Medicine</h1>
      <p>
         The WSMA will advocate and raise awareness for gender parity, equal pay, and advancement as a fundamental professional standard to ensure
         equal opportunity within the medical profession in Washington. (Res B-2, A-20)
      </p>

      <p>
         The WSMA ensure and encourage gender equity in WSMA leadership, HOD reference committees, speakers showcased at WSMA events, articles in WSMA
         Reports and grants and/or awards. (Res B-2, A-20)
      </p>

      <p>
         The WSMA endorses the American Medical Association’s policy, “Gender Disparities in Physician Income and Advancement” that reads as follows:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
         Gender Disparities in Physician Income and Advancement 1. That our American Medical Association encourage medical associations and other
         relevant organizations to study gender differences in income and advancement trends, by specialty, experience, work hours and other practice
         characteristics, and develop programs to address disparities where they exist; 2. That our AMA support physicians in making informed
         decisions on work-life balance issues through the continued development of informational resources on issues such as part-time work options,
         job sharing, flexible scheduling, reentry, and contract negotiations; 3. That our AMA urge medical schools, hospitals, group practices and
         other physician employers to institute and monitor transparency in pay levels in order to identify and eliminate gender bias and promote
         gender equity throughout the profession; 4. That our AMA collect and publicize information on best practices in academic medicine and non
         academic medicine that foster gender parity in the profession; and 5. That our AMA provide training on leadership development, contract and
         salary negotiations and career advancement strategies, to combat gender disparities as a member benefit. (Res B-2, A-20)
