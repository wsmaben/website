      <h1>Benefits</h1>
      <p>
         The WSMA believes that all governmental and private health insurance programs should provide benefits for emotional and mental illness that
         are equivalent in scope and duration to those benefits provided for other illnesses. (Res 9, B-86; Res C-10, A-00) (Reaffirmed A-17)
      </p>

      <p>The WSMA acknowledges the continued lack of mental health treatment parity for Washingtonians (C-13, A-20)</p>
      <p>
         The WSMA supports the utilization of county and national entities, such as mental health crisis centers and phone lines, in triaging callers,
         directing individuals to appropriate health and social services, and providing information on free and low-cost avenues to both public and
         private mental-health and substance use disorder treatments (C-13, A-20)
      </p>
