<h1>Mental Health Care</h1>
<p>
The WSMA encourages lessening the barriers to providing appropriate medical and psychiatric treatment to mentally ill patients whose illness renders them incapable of making rational treatment decisions on their own behalf, while at the same time respecting the mentally ill individual’s right to self-determination when this would not result in negative consequences to the individual or to others or to property. (Amended A-19)
