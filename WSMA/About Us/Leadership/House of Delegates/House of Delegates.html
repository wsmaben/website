      <h2>About the House of Delegates</h2>
      <p>
         The WSMA House of Delegates is comprised of elected delegates from each
         county medical society, qualified state specialty societies and members
         of the
         <a
            href="[@]WSMA/About/Leadership/Board_of_Trustees/Board_of_Trustees.aspx"
         >
            WSMA Board of Trustees
         </a>
         . There is one resident delegate, one student delegate and one young
         physician delegate. Each county society has one delegate for every 50
         active WSMA members.
      </p>
      <p>
         Each medical specialty society is entitled to elect or appoint one
         delegate and one alternate, provided that such specialty society has as
         members at least one hundred active members of the WSMA, or if the
         specialty society has fewer than 100 members, 50 percent of its members
         must belong to the WSMA.

      <a id="operations"></a>
      <h2>How the House of Delegates Operates</h2>
      <p>
         The WSMA House of Delegates meets once a year, typically in September
         or October (learn more about the

         ). The House may also be called into special session at any time by the
         WSMA president on the written request of fifteen members of the House.
      </p>
      <p>
         All business of the House is conducted according to parliamentary

         Procedure."
