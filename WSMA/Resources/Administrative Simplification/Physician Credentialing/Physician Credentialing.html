            ) that, for the first time in our state's history, streamlines and
            standardizes applications and limits the turnaround time for
            insurers to approve or deny those requests*.
         </p>
         <p>As a result, starting June 1, 2018:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>
               Insurers must credential physicians and providers within 90 days
               (and an average of 60 days, beginning in 2020).
            </li>
            <li>
               Insurers, physicians and providers must use ProviderSource to
               submit and process credentialing applications.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </div>
      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>
         Two major problems exist with insurers' credentialing systems, both
         stemming from a lack of standardization. First, each insurer has a
         unique process that requires some, but not all, of the same information
         from physicians. A physician contracting with 15 insurers in our state
         must complete each company's respective credentialing process&mdash;a
         time-consuming endeavor. Second, it may take months for an insurance
         carrier to approve an application, preventing physicians from providing
         care to their patients in those networks&mdash;and from earning an
         income&mdash;for a good portion of a year.
      </p>
      <h3>The process</h3>
      <p>
         Starting in June 2018, you must submit applications to insurance
         carriers via ProviderSource, a free health care credentialing tool
         operated by OneHealthPort, the state's lead organization providing
         health information technology. ProviderSource will allow you to build a
         comprehensive professional profile, which also functions as a secure,
         universal credentialing and enrollment application. Once submitted,
         insurance carriers will have 90 days to approve your application. Note
         that 90 days is the ceiling; as all parties are required to use
         ProviderSource, we anticipate a reduction in the back-and-forth that
         tends to slow this process down, resulting in faster turnaround times.
      </p>

         Are insurers allowing your practice to benefit from the new
         requirements?
      </h3>
      <p>
         With the provisions of HB 2335 now in effect, are the insurers you
         contract with using ProviderSource to credential your physicians and
         providers within 90 days? If the answer is "no":

         , developed by the WSMA and the Washington State Medical Group
         Management Association, reminding reluctant insurance companies to
         follow the law and allow your practice to benefit from the legislation.
         After downloading, simply plug in your practice information and send
         the letter to your contact at each insurer with which you contract.
      </p>
      <p>
         With insurers and physicians using ProviderSource, the hope is to make
         the credentialing process easier for small to midsized practices that
         do not benefit from delegation arrangements*. We are interested in
         hearing whether insurance companies are complying with this law and the
         details of their responses. Please email Jeb Shepard, associate
         director of legislative and regulatory affairs, at
         <a href="mailto:jeb@wsma.org">jeb@wsma.org</a>
         with your feedback.
