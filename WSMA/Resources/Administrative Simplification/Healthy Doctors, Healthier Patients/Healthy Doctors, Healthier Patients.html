      <strong>WSMA’s Healthy Doctors, Healthier Patients initiative to improve physician satisfaction and decrease burnout seeks to reduce the
        administrative burdens that get in the way of providing optimal patient care.
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Physicians have a clear mission: Provide the best quality of care possible for their patients. Yet the tsunami of regulations
      emanating from carriers, the state and federal levels generate significant and sometimes unintended consequences. Through our Healthy
      Doctors, Healthier Patients initiative, the WSMA is tackling administrative burdens with legislative, regulatory and market-based
      approaches. Learn more about our work on this page. And be sure to visit our
      <a href="[@]WSMA/Resources/Physician_Wellness/Physician_Wellness.aspx">Physician Wellness page</a> for tools to help clinicians manage
      the stressors that place their emotional and physical well-being at risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Healthy Doctors, Healthier Patients campaign is successful when we hear from you. Email Jeb Shepard, WSMA's associate director of
      health policy and regulatory affairs, at <a href="mailto:jeb@wsma.org">jeb@wsma.org</a> with your feedback.

        <h3>Prescription monitoring program</h3>
        <p>
          In partnership with the WSHA, we brought forth successful legislation making it easier for groups of physicians to use the state’s
          prescription monitoring program and increasing incentives to boost participation. As a result:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The Department of Health is on track to make the state’s prescription monitoring program accessible to prescribers without a DEA
            license who prescribe legend drugs, extending access to this valuable prescribing data to approximately 14,000 additional
            providers.
          </li>
          <li>
            The legislation authorizes clinics and facilities with five or more prescribing providers to register with the program on behalf
            of individual providers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Interim measures currently allow facilities and clinics to send requests using the license of a medical director with an active
            Prescription Review account.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In our comments to the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services regarding its proposed rule on MACRA (the Medicare Access and
          CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015), the WSMA urged CMS to give priority weight to all physician use of state prescription drug
          monitoring programs when calculating scores for the new Merit-Based Incentive Payment System, to increase financial incentives for
          physicians to use these important programs.
        </p>
        <h3>Smooth workflow</h3>
        <p>
          Workflows of clinics and facilities that use medical assistants to retrieve medication were at risk, due to a misinterpretation of
          language in the MA scope-of-practice statute. During the 2016 legislative session, we focused on minimizing unnecessary
          interruptions in practice operations. As a result:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Beginning June 1, 2016, the “administering” of a drug, including both retrieval and application of medication, by a medical
            assistant, is now in statute—meaning groups that use medical assistants to retrieve medication can retain their current
            workflows.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Mental health paperwork reduction</h3>
        <p>
          In 2017, the WSMA successfully supported House Bill 1819, requiring the Department of Social and Health Services to immediately
          review its behavioral health services documentation and paperwork requirements and eliminate duplication and inefficiencies, and,
          by April 2018, provide agencies a single set of streamlined regulations covering mental health, substance use disorder and
          co-occurring disorder treatments for children. The legislation provides administrative relief to physicians, removing barriers
          that prevent timely access to mental health services for children.
        </p>
        <h3>Disability parking permits</h3>
        <p>
          During the 2017 legislative session, the WSMA successfully supported House Bill 1515, increasing the number of ways health care
          practitioners can authorize disability parking permits. Legislation from 2014 had required health care practitioners authorizing
          disabled parking permits to use a prescription pad or paper. HB 1515, brought to legislators by the WSMA, modernizes the statute
          and eases administrative burden by allowing for authorization of parking permits on office letterhead or by electronic means. The
          Department of Licensing will establish rules governing electronic authorization.
