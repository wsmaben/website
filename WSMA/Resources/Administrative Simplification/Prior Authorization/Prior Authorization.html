      <h3>New state rules and the WSMA Prior Authorization Navigator</h3>
      <p>
         In January 2018, new state rules streamlining and standardizing prior
         authorization programs for medical services used by Washington
         insurers* went into effect, marking the culmination of years of
         negotiation between the WSMA, the Washington State Hospital Association
         and the Office of the Insurance Commissioner (OIC), and representing a
         major victory in the WSMA's
         <a
            href="[@]WSMA/Resources/Administrative_Simplification/Healthy_Doctors__Healthier_Patients/Healthy_Doctors__Healthier_Patients.aspx"
         >
            Healthy Doctors, Healthier Patients initiative
         </a>
         . The new regulations clarify definitions, set timelines for standard
         and expedited requests, establish clear communication requirements and
         much more. Similar OIC rules for prescription drug prior authorization
         programs passed in 2015.
      </p>
      <p>
         To help you adjust your workflows to accommodate the new requirements,
         the WSMA has introduced the
         <strong>Prior Authorization Navigator</strong>
         &mdash;a mobile-friendly "one-stop-shop" website for guidance on the
         new rules. On the Navigator, you'll find a one-minute bullet-point
         summary of the new rules as well as in-depth guidance on the rules'
         provisions. You'll also find guidance on 2015 rules covering prior
         authorization of prescription drugs.
