			<p><strong>In a recent survey of WSMA members, prior authorization&mdash;with its numerous requirements, ever-changing criteria, and reliance on outdated technology (fax machines and 800 numbers)&mdash;was identified as the paramount administrative challenge faced by physicians and practices. </strong></p>
			<p>Accordingly, <a href="[@]WSMA/Resources/Administrative_Simplification/Healthy_Doctors__Healthier_Patients/Healthy_Doctors__Healthier_Patients.aspx">Healthy Doctors, Healthier Patients</a>, WSMA's initiative to improve professional satisfaction among physicians by addressing the causes of burnout, made improving prior authorization processes it's number one goal.</p>

		<h3>New state rules and the WSMA Prior Authorization Navigator</h3>
		<p>In January 2018, new state rules streamlining and standardizing prior authorization programs for medical services used by Washington insurers* went into effect, marking the culmination of years of negotiation between the WSMA, the Washington State Hospital Association and the Office of the Insurance Commissioner (OIC), and representing a major victory in the WSMA's <a href="[@]WSMA/Resources/Administrative_Simplification/Healthy_Doctors__Healthier_Patients/Healthy_Doctors__Healthier_Patients.aspx">Healthy Doctors, Healthier Patients initiative</a>. The new regulations clarify definitions, set timelines for standard and expedited requests, establish clear communication requirements and much more. Similar OIC rules for prescription drug prior authorization programs passed in 2015.</p>
		<p>To help you adjust your workflows to accommodate the new requirements, the WSMA has introduced the <strong>Prior Authorization Navigator</strong>&mdash;a mobile-friendly "one-stop-shop" website for guidance on the new rules. On the Navigator, you'll find a one-minute bullet-point summary of the new rules as well as in-depth guidance on the rules' provisions. You'll also find guidance on 2015 rules covering prior authorization of prescription drugs.</p>

		<p><em>*The new rules apply to plans the OIC regulates: Individual (both on and off the Washington Health Benefit Exchange) and small and large groups (other than self-insured). The rule does not apply to Medicaid managed care organizations and Medicaid fee-for-service plans, Medicare, Taft-Hartley plans, PEBB/Uniform Medical and Tricare. </em></p>
