			<h1>Choosing Wisely</h1>
			<p>
				Physicians play a critical role in initiating conversations about appropriate care with patients and other clinicians. A national initiative of the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) Foundation, Choosing Wisely aims to promote conversations between physicians and patients by helping patients choose care that is:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Supported by evidence</li>
				<li>Not duplicative of other tests or procedures already received</li>
				<li>Free from harm</li>
				<li>Truly necessary</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Choosing Wisely has enlisted more than 60 medical specialty societies to create lists of "Things Physicians and Patients Should Question," which provide specific evidence-based recommendations for conversations on the risks and benefits of various medical tests. To date, there are more than <a href="http://www.choosingwisely.org/getting-started/lists/">500 recommendations available</a>.</p>
		</div>
		<p>The WSMA offers resources for patients, physicians and care teams, designed to help raise public awareness and garner support around Choosing Wisely's recommendations. Review our resources below. To learn more about the Choosing Wisely initiative, visit the national <a href="http://choosingwisely.org/">Choosing Wisely</a> website.</p>
		<div>
			<div class="col-lg-4 col-xs-12 pull-right"><img alt="Know Your Choices, Ask Your Doctor logo" src="/images/Logos/Know_Your_Choices_300px.jpg" /></div>
			<p>The WSMA introduced the national Choosing Wisely initiative to Washington state in 2012 as part of its <a href="[@]WSMA/Resources/Clinical_Quality/Know_Your_Choices_Ask_Your_Doctor/Know_Your_Choices_Ask_Your_Doctor.aspx">Know Your Choices, Ask Your Doctor initiative</a>, and partnered with the Washington State Hospital Association and the Washington Health Alliance to help raise public awareness around appropriate test utilization. The three organizations co-sponsor the Washington State Choosing Wisely Task Force, a group of more than 20 medical leaders from the largest health care organizations in the state, tasked with developing resources for physicians and health care facilities.</p>

				<p>Sometimes good medicine is about what <em>not</em> to do. Choosing Wisely&reg; encourages patients to talk with their physicians about the necessity of various tests and procedures. The following guidance can help you talk to your physician, help you understand what questions to ask and what evidence your physician is using to best treat your individual condition.</p>
				<h3>Things physicians and patients should question</h3>
				<p>The more you know, the more prepared you will be to ask your physician questions, understand recommendations and weigh the pros and cons of treatment options&mdash;all of which add up to getting the right care to best treat your individual condition.</p>
				<p>Choosing Wisely has enlisted more than 60 medical specialty societies to create lists of "Things Physicians and Patients Should Question," which provide specific evidence-based recommendations for conversations on the risks and benefits of various medical tests. To date, there are over 500 recommendations available.</p>
				<p>Visit the <a href="http://www.choosingwisely.org/patient-resources/">Choosing Wisely website</a> to find these recommendations, searchable by subject and keyword.</p>
				<h3>Five questions to ask your doctor</h3>
				<p>Want to ask your physician or health care provider about a test, diagnosis or treatment but don't know where to start? Choosing Wisely offers guidance to help you talk to your physician, such as what questions to ask and what evidence he/she is using to best treat your individual condition.</p>
				<p>Our goal is to promote informed conversations between physician and patient and to encourage shared decision-making. These five questions may help guide the conversation for both the patient and the health care provider to ensure the right care is delivered at the right time:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<strong>Do I really need this test or procedure?</strong> Medical tests help you and your health care provider decide how to treat a problem. And medical procedures help to actually treat it.<br />
						<br />
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>What are the risks?</strong> Will there be side effects? What are the chances of getting results that aren't accurate? Could that lead to more testing or another procedure?<br />
						<br />
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Are there simpler, safer options?</strong> Sometimes all you need to do is make lifestyle changes, such as eating healthier foods or exercising more.<br />
						<br />
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>What happens if I don't do anything?</strong> Ask if your condition might get worse&mdash;or better&mdash;if you don't have the test or procedure right away.<br />
						<br />
					</li>
					<li><strong>How much does it cost?</strong> Ask if there are less expensive tests, treatments or procedures, what your insurance may cover, and about generic drugs instead of brand-name drugs.</li>
				</ol>

				<p>The following tools can help you integrate Choosing Wisely's evidence-based best practices into your practice or organization.</p>
				<h3>Choosing Wisely Action Manual</h3>
				<p>For physicians or other health care leaders struggling with how to integrate Choosing Wisely's evidence-based best practices into their practices or organizations, the Choosing Wisely Action Manual takes a step-by-step approach to making system-level changes. The manual was created by the Washington State Choosing Wisely Task Force, a group of more than 20 medical leaders from the largest health care organizations in the state. The task force is co-sponsored by the WSMA, the Washington Health Alliance and the Washington State Hospital Association.</p>

				<h3>Measuring Choosing Wisely recommendations in Washington state</h3>
				<p>In 2014, the first statewide study in the nation to measure Choosing Wisely recommendations was published by the Washington Health Alliance in conjunction with the Washington State Choosing Wisely Task Force. The study, based upon claims data representing 3.3 million lives in Washington state, finds that patients in Washington may be exposed to care that they don't need&mdash;and potential harm. A second report, published in 2016, showed improvement on six recommendations. The reports offer county-by-county results for nine different Choosing Wisely recommendations, and are based on the Choosing Wisely Claims-Based Technical Specifications (email <a href="mailto:jessica@wsma.org">jessica@wsma.org</a> to request a copy).</p>

				<h3>Drop the pre-op!</h3>
				<p>Physicians agree: All patients need pre-op evaluation, but a low-risk patient having a low-risk procedure does not need pre-op testing. Providing high-quality care to patients includes eliminating unnecessary tests, treatments and procedures. Based on results from the 2018 "First Do No Harm" report, the Washington State Choosing Wisely Task Force focused efforts on unnecessary pre-op testing and developed resources you can use to improve your practice and educate your colleagues.</p>

Post one in your exam room, or have them available in your waiting room. Any one of these five questions can help start the conversation for both the patient and physician to ensure the right care is delivered at the right time:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Do I really need this test or procedure?</li>
					<li>What are the risks?</li>

				<h3>Web-based education for physicians</h3>
				<p>Interactive instructional modules, based on specialty society recommendations from the Choosing Wisely campaign, are available. By completing the modules, physicians will learn strategies to build trust and address patient attitudes and beliefs.</p>
