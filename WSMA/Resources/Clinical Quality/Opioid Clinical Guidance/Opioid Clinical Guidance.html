               Designed by physicians, Better Prescribing, Better Treatment is a peer-to-peer, non-punitive initiative aimed at ensuring physicians
               and other prescribers who see Medicaid patients in Washington state are not overprescribing addictive medications while keeping
               appropriate pain treatments accessible for patients who need them. The initiative was developed in partnership with the Washington
               State Health Care Authority, the agency responsible for administering the state's Medicaid program (Apple Health), and the Washington
               State Hospital Association. Better Prescribing, Better Treatment is a component of
               <a href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/Portals/1/Documents/1000/140-182-StateOpioidResponsePlan.pdf">the state opioid response plan</a>.
            </p>
            <p>Better Prescribing, Better Treatment takes a three-pronged approach to safe prescribing:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <strong>Apple Health prescribing policy</strong>. The initiative established a
                  <a href="https://www.hca.wa.gov/billers-providers-partners/programs-and-services/opioids">new opioid prescribing policy</a>
                  for Washington's Apple Health program that introduced new pill limits for all opioid prescriptions written for the treatment of
                  acute pain.
               </li>
               <li>
                  <strong>Prescriber discretion</strong>. The initiative established a non-burdensome process for automated exemption that allows the
                  prescribing clinician to overrule those limits if it's in the best interest of their patient by simply documenting in the medical
                  record and indicating the exemption on the prescription. Importantly, this approach avoids the additional paperwork and
                  administrative burden that accompany similar policies adopted in other states and that can take time away from patient care.
               </li>
               <li>
                  <strong>Physician-led feedback program</strong>. The initiative introduced
                  <a href="https://waopiatereports.org/">Washington Opioid Reports</a>, a feedback reporting program that provides data compiled from
                  the state's prescription monitoring program to physicians and other prescribing providers allowing them to see how their opioid
                  prescribing practices compare to others in their health care system and specialty.
               </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Getting results</h3>
            <p>
               Better Prescribing, Better Treatment's data-driven and data-sharing approach is working. The initiative, now encompassing 17,000+
               prescribers at more than 20 health systems and groups in the state, has
               <a
                  href="[@]Shared_Content/News/Press_Releases/2018/Public-private_safe_prescribing_initiative_results_in_reductions_in_Medicaid_opioid_prescriptions.aspx"
                  >reduced opioid prescriptions exceeding the new Apple Health guidelines by nearly 70 percent</a
               >
               since its inception in late 2017.
            </p>
            <h3>How to enroll</h3>
            <p>
               If you see Medicaid patients and your organization has yet to enroll to receive Washington Opioid Reports, simply email
               <a href="mailto:opioidreports@wsma.org">opioidreports@wsma.org</a> to enroll. Minimal resources and administrative burden required.
            </p>
            <h3>Statewide opioid feedback program</h3>
            <p>
               Plans are underway to expand Better Prescribing, Better Treatment's data-leveraging strategy to all opioid prescribers in Washington
               state. We anticipate this expanded statewide opioid feedback program to be available in the first quarter of 2019.

               Washington state's prescription monitoring program, Prescription Review, is a crucial tool in helping to stem the frequency of
               medication abuse and overdose. Started in 2011 and run through the Department of Health, Prescription Review uses a secure platform to
               allow a prescribing physician to access crucial patient information before prescribing, such as duplicate prescribing, misuse, drug
               interactions and other potential concerns. This information can help to determine appropriate medical treatment and referral needs. As
               physicians, you play a crucial role in protecting your patients' health and safety.

            <h3>Medical groups and health systems: Integrating your EHR with the state prescription monitoring program</h3>
            <p>
               Group and health system executives: As leaders in your communities, the WSMA and the Washington State Hospital Association encourage
               you to provide as many tools as possible to your physicians and other prescribers to combat the opioid crisis. This includes
               low-barrier access to real-time state prescription monitoring program data by integrating your electronic health record with the PMP
               database.
            </p>
            <p>
               Integrating PMP data directly into your EHR is an important tool to addressing the opioid crisis and the right thing to do for
               Washington patients. Allowing physicians and providers real-time access to patients' prescriptive history supports optimal clinical
               decision-making within the time constraints of a patient encounter. Also, there are new PMP mandates in the opioid prescribing
               rulemaking that resulted from House Bill 1427 (passed by the Washington State Legislature in 2017). Many of these mandates are set to
               go into effect in 2019. Integrating your hospital or group's medical record with the PMP will help ensure your physicians and other
               providers are able to meet new state requirements while minimizing disruption to patient care*.
            </p>
            <p>If your EHR vendor is Epic&reg;, NextGen&reg;, Cerner&reg;, or AllScripts&reg;, we encourage you to:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Contact your vendor and express your desire to integrate PMP data.</li>
               <li>Prioritize the integration of PMP data to your EHR with your IT department.</li>
               <li>Work with your vendor to install the update for the PMP connection.</li>
               <li>Work with our statewide health information exchange, OneHealthPort, to connect the PMP data to your vendor.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
               Technical guidance for practice IT departments and vendors please visit the Department of Health's
               <a
                  href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/ForPublicHealthandHealthcareProviders/HealthcareProfessionsandFacilities/PrescriptionMonitoringProgramPMP"

               Unfortunately, not all EHR vendors offer an integration pathway. For those vendors that have not yet developed an integration pathway,
               consider urging them to develop a Washington-compliant interface as soon as possible. The DOH website provides
               <a

                  >OneHealthPort</a
               >.
            </p>
            <p>
               We understand resources are required to integrate these platforms, and the WSMA and WSHA will continue to advocate for reasonable
               regulatory policies and funding opportunities to help offset the costs of integrating EHRs with the PMP.

               <em
                  >**Washington state has built a non-proprietary, open-source connection for the PMP to integrate with certified EHR systems. This
                  connection is based on a standard that all certified EHRs already use. The first hospital in Washington went live with their EHR
                  connection with Epic&reg; last year. Since that first connection, 17 other medical entities representing over 900 hospitals and
                  clinics across the state have connected their EHR systems to the PMP database. Six more medical organizations are actively testing
                  connections or exploring implementation. We have seen tremendous growth in 2018. In January 2018, there were roughly 200,000 queries
                  of the PMP and by September 2018 there were over 1.5 million queries as a result of these connections.</em

            New rules governing opioid prescribing are now in effect for most prescribing professions in Washington state, including physicians and
            physician assistants, prompted by House Bill 1427 from 2017.
         </p>
         <p>
            The comprehensive rules represent a significant change in how opioids are prescribed. Key provisions applicable to all prescribing
            physicians and PAs include:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>
               A seven-day pill limit for acute prescriptions and 14 days for acute operative pain, with an exemption to these limits when clinical
               judgment is documented in the medical record.
            </li>
            <li>A specific care plan and documentation requirements for each phase of pain.</li>
            <li>Mandated registration and targeted checks of the prescription drug monitoring program.</li>
            <li>Required continuing medical education on opioid prescribing.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>
            There are some differing requirements between Washington Medical Commission and the Board of Osteopathic Medicine and Surgery rulemaking.
            Prescribing clinicians are advised to review this

         <p>
            Also, allopathic physician and PA prescribers should note that simply reading the new rules will meet the new state requirement for opioid
            continuing medical education. Find links to the final rules on the WSMA website on the

               >Opioid Clinical Guidance page</a
            >. The MD or PA should note which WACs they reviewed and the date and keep that document with their other CME certificates. Note that a
            review of the rules does not meet the new state opioid CME requirement for osteopathic physicians and PAs.

            <p>
               Released March 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain provides
               recommendations for primary care clinicians who are prescribing opioids for chronic pain outside of active cancer treatment, palliative
               care and end-of-life care. The guideline addresses: 1) when to initiate or continue opioids for chronic pain; 2) opioid selection,
               dosage, duration, follow-up, and discontinuation; and 3) assessing risk and addressing harms of opioid use.

            <h3>AMDG 2015 Interagency opioid prescribing guidelines</h3>
            <p>
               Washington state was one of the first states to respond to the opioid epidemic. The first edition of the Washington State Agency
               Medical Directors' Group opioid guidelines, published in 2007, was the first attempt in the U.S. to reduce prescribing of high doses of
               opioids associated with unintentional overdose.
            </p>
            <p>
               In 2015, the AMDG published the third edition of its Interagency Guideline on Prescribing Opioids for Pain. This edition expands focus
               to include opioid use in acute, subacute, and perioperative pain phases and in special populations; includes sections on tapering and
               opioid use disorder.
            </p>
            <p>
               AMDG medical treatment guidelines are published as an educational tool for medical providers caring for patients of state agency
               programs.

            <p>
               The Medical Quality Assurance Commission's final rules for management of chronic non-cancer pain became effective Jan. 2, 2012. The
               rules apply to physicians who treat patients with opioids for chronic non-cancer pain (as defined in the rules). The rules do not apply
               to physicians providing palliative care, hospice care, or other forms of end-of-life care. The rules also do not apply to the
               management of acute pain related to an injury or surgical procedure.

            </p>
            <p>
               To help allay legitimate concerns from physicians regarding fear of state sanction for treatment of patients on opioids, the Medical
               Quality Assurance Commission has issued, at the request of the WSMA, a technical assistance letter which addresses three points: the
               intent of the MQAC pain rules; opioid prescribing levels, and; what counts as a consultation requirement. We'll update this link as
               additional guidance from MQAC becomes available.

            <p>
               Updated September 2016, the recommendations in this guideline apply to adult patients who are already on chronic opioid therapy for the
               treatment of chronic non-cancer pain. Group Health's guideline is consistent with the regulations, and providers adhering to the
               guideline will be compliant with the law. The guidelines are intended to provide a MINIMUM standard of care, and are based on the legal
               requirements defined by Washington State Administrative code (WAC).

               The goal of this program is to give providers timely information to coordinate prescribing, support treatment interventions, and stop
               overdose deaths.

                  Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for Extended-Release and Long-Acting Opioids</a
               ><br />
               On July 9, 2012, FDA approved a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) for extended-release (ER) and long-acting (LA) opioid
               medications.
            </p>
            <p>
               ER/LA opioids are highly potent drugs that are approved to treat moderate to severe persistent pain for serious and chronic conditions.
               The misuse and abuse of these drugs have resulted in a serious public health crisis of addiction, overdose and death.
            </p>
            <p>
               The REMS is part of a multi-agency federal effort to address the growing problem of prescription drug abuse and misuse. The REMS
               introduces new safety measures to reduce risks and improve safe use of ER/LA opioids while continuing to provide access to these
               medications for patients in pain.

                  >What physicians need to know about recent federal policy changes,including the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) of
                  2016</a

               (Updated Nov. 2016)
            </p>
            <p>
               With passage of CARA, and changes made by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's final rule, Congress and the
               White House have made a number of policy changes to combat the opioid epidemic-some of which physicians can leverage immediately. To
               bring members up to speed, the WSMA has prepared this guidance document, which contains information on federal policy changes,
               particularly those that address medication-assisted treatment (MAT)-the use of medications together with behavioral therapy to treat
               substance use disorders. The guidance includes new information on patient limits, which practitioners can prescribe buprenorphine, and
               partial prescription fills for controlled substances.

                  ROAM and ECHO: Defeating Opiate Addiction in Rural Washington</a
               ><br />
               Two initiatives to help providers grapple with the disparate problems of addiction and pain management. ROAM (the Rural Opiate
               Addiction Management) Collaborative, launched by UW Medicine and Washington State University, seeks to help manage the widespread issue
               of opiate addiction in rural Washington. COPE (Collaborative Opioid Prescribing Education), launched by UW Medicine is an online
               educational tool that helps providers communicate to patients about how best to manage treatment of chronic, non-cancer-related pain.
