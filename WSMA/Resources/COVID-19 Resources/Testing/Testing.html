      <p>
         State officials are urging physicians and medical providers to increase testing to help the state identify those infected with the
         virus. Updated guidance and resources below. Be sure to check the
         <a href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/NovelCoronavirusOutbreak2020COVID19/HealthcareProviders"
            >DOH health care provider webpage</a
         >
         for the most up-to-date guidance.
      </p>
      <h3>How can physicians and providers help?</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>Test all persons with any symptom that could be consistent with COVID-19.</li>
         <li>Test all close contacts (&lt; 6 ft. of distance for &gt; 15 minutes).</li>
         <li>Use self-collected nasal swabs if the person is able to.</li>
         <li>Complete all required information on requisition to include:</li>
         <ul>
            <li>Complete contact information.</li>
            <li>Race/ethnicity.</li>
         </ul>
         <li>Provide public health centered counseling around:</li>
         <ul>
            <li>What and how to isolate and quarantine (see patient resources below for assistance).</li>
            <li>Assess support needs.</li>
            <li>How important it is to do this.</li>
            <li>
               If they are positive that they will be contacted by public health and why it is important that they provide contact
               information.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </ul>
      <p>
         Symptomatic patients should be tested within 24 hours or referred to another testing site and provided guidance (see below) on the
         need to isolate (for ill persons) and self-quarantine (for exposed contacts).
      </p>
      <h3>Use in-state labs for testing</h3>
      <p>
         The DOH is now strongly encouraging clinicians to use our in-state labs for COVID-19 testing so that we can shorten the turn-around
         time for test results. The following is a list of Washington-based labs that have confirmed their willingness to provide molecular
         COVID-19 testing to hospitals and clinics. Please feel free to reach out to these labs to discuss:
