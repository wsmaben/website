			During the COVID-19 crisis, sensible telehealth policies are essential to allow physicians and practices to continue providing preventive, acute, and chronic care for their patients, in a manner that keeps our health care workforce safe, and to protect physician practice viability.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Here's what you need to know to best utilize telehealth in your practice:</strong>
		</p>
		<p><strong>HIPAA relaxed at the federal level:</strong> The Health and Human Services agency has <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/special-topics/emergency-preparedness/notification-enforcement-discretion-telehealth/index.html">relaxed HIPAA regulations</a> for physicians using telehealth to treat their patients. This change allows for the use of video chat applications (FaceTime, Skype, etc.) to provide telehealth services.</p>
		<p><strong>Office of the Insurance Commissioner OKs the use of non-HIPAA compliant platforms including telephone:</strong> The OIC has <a href="https://www.insurance.wa.gov/sites/default/files/documents/emergency-order-20-02_3.pdf?utm_content=&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_name=&amp;utm_source=govdelivery&amp;utm_term=">issued an order</a> requiring all state-regulated carriers to permit and reimburse for care provided over non-HIPAA compliant platforms - including video chat applications and the telephone.</p>
		<p><strong>Governor Inslee's proclamation requires payment parity:</strong> The <a href="https://www.insurance.wa.gov/sites/default/files/documents/emergency-order-20-02_3.pdf?utm_content=&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_name=&amp;utm_source=govdelivery&amp;utm_term=">proclamation implements SB 5385</a> - requiring telemedicine services to be paid for at parity with face-to-face services - immediately.</p>
		<p><strong>Medicaid also paying at parity:</strong> Medicaid, including MCOs and FFS, are <a href="https://www.hca.wa.gov/health-care-services-and-supports/hca-supports-increased-telehealth-options-medicaid-clients-public">both paying for telehealth</a> - including services administered over the telephone - at parity.</p>
		<p><strong>Medicare relaxing telehealth requirements:</strong> The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services has <a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/medicare-telemedicine-health-care-provider-fact-sheet">expanded telehealth services</a> and <a href="https://www.cms.gov/files/document/covid-19-physicians-and-practitioners.pdf" target="_blank">waived certain telemedicine regulations</a> for Medicare beneficiaries during the 2019 Novel Coronavirus pandemic.</p>

					Telemedicine allows patients to continue to receive the care they need to manage chronic conditions or minor illness from the safety of their own home. During this public health crisis, allowing patients to receive health care in their homes is safer for the patient as well as the practitioner and their staff.
				</p>
				<p>Larger practices and systems currently using telehealth technology are working to scale up those services as demand for COVID-19 testing increases. Smaller and midsized physician practices may want to consider adopting telehealth, which is <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/preparing-communities.html">recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> to help mitigate the impact and prevent the spread of COVID-19. Telehealth can:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Enable people to access care and initial screenings from their home.</li>
					<li>Minimize the demands on in-person primary care offices, urgent care centers, and emergency departments.</li>
					<li>Minimize the use of personal protective equipment like gloves and masks.</li>
					<li>Reduce the risk of exposure to patients and medical care teams.</li>
					<li>Ensure that treatment is available for high-need patients.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Setting up telehealth at your practice</h3>
				<h4>Toolkits</h4>
				<p><a href="https://telehealth.hhs.gov/providers/">The Provider Page</a> (of the <a href="https://telehealth.hhs.gov/">HHS Telehealth Toolkit for Providers and Your Patients</a>) contains comprehensive guidance on how to get started, plan your telehealth workflow, and prepare patients.

				<h4>Technical Resources</h4>
				<p>The Health Care Authority has purchased a limited number of licenses for Zoom, a video conferencing technology that can help physicians provide virtual care. The HCA will distribute the licenses free of charge to physicians and providers who have a meaningful need and who don't already have access to telehealth technology, including physicians in smaller practices. Visit <a href="https://www.hca.wa.gov/billers-providers-partners/prior-authorization-claims-and-billing/request-zoom-license-connect">the HCA website to apply</a>. We believe this offer by the HCA is a direct result of our advocacy on behalf of our small practice physicians, and we thank the agency for making these available. (March 20, 2020)</p>

				<h3>HIPAA</h3>
				<p>On March 17, The HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR) <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/special-topics/emergency-preparedness/notification-enforcement-discretion-telehealth/index.html">relaxed HIPAA regulations</a> for covered health care providers using telehealth during the public health emergency due to COVID-19, effective immediately. This change allows for the use of any non-public facing remote communication product (video chat applications) to provide telehealth services. This includes Apple FaceTime, Facebook Messenger video chat, Google Hangouts video, and Skype.</p>
				<p>The OCR has issued <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/telehealth-faqs-508.pdf" target="_blank">FAQs</a> about its use of enforcement discretion related to HIPAA and telehealth</p>
				<p>See the HHS <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/special-topics/hipaa-covid19/index.html">HIPAA and COVID-19 website</a> for all OCR HIPAA announcements and guidance.</p>
				<h3>Stark Law</h3>
				<p>On April 21, 2020, CMS issued an <a href="https://www.cms.gov/files/document/explanatory-guidance-march-30-2020-blanket-waivers-section-1877g-social-security-act.pdf" target="_blank">explanatory guidance document</a> of the Stark Law <a href="https://www.faegredrinker.com/en/insights/publications/2020/3/cms-blanket-waivers-to-the-stark-law-offer-relief-to-providers-during-covid-19-emergency">blanket waivers</a> (issued March 30, 2020). Retroactive to March 1, the blanket waivers provide protection from the Stark Law as long as the financial relationship pertains to at least one COVID-19 purpose. (Note: Stark Law waivers are not the same as Stark Law exceptions - Be certain to consult with your health care lawyer in connection with application of the Blanket Waivers and the OIG policy statement.)</p>
				<h3>Prescribing controlled substances</h3>
				<h4>Federal</h4>
				<p>DEA-registered practitioners may now issue prescriptions for controlled substances to patients for whom they have not conducted an in-person medical evaluation, provided certain conditions are met. <a href="https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/coronavirus.html">Read the DEA announcement.</a> (March 16, 2020)</p>
				<p>DEA <a href="https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/coronavirus.html">COVID-19 Information Page</a></p>
				<p><a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/programs_campaigns/medication_assisted/dea-information-telemedicine.pdf" target="_blank">SAMHSA: DEA Information on Prescribing for Controlled Substance by Telemedicine</a></p>
				<h4>State</h4>
				<p>Emergency rule change for Schedule II prescribers: On April 21, 2020, the Pharmacy Quality Assurance Commission (PQAC) temporarily eased the regulations on practitioners who prescribe Schedule II substances due to the COVID-19 public health emergency. The emergency rule increases the amount of time a practitioner has to deliver a signed prescription when authorizing an emergency prescription of a Schedule II substance to the pharmacy from seven days to fifteen days. The emergency rule also allows for a practitioner to accomplish the "signed prescription" requirement through paper, electronic transmission, facsimile, photograph, or scanned copy. The <a href="https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/WADOH/2020/04/22/file_attachments/1432948/FinalCR103Emergency_4030_704419-PQAC-ScheduleII%20substances%20during%20COVID-19.pdf" target="_blank">emergency rule</a> is effective immediately and will remain enforce for 120 days.</p>
				<h3>Substance Use Disorder Treatment</h3>
				<p>SAMHSA has offered flexibilities to states to ensure that individuals being treated with medication for opioid use disorders can continue to receive their medication during the PHE for the COVID-19 pandemic. See their <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/coronavirus">website</a> for complete information.</p>
				<p>On March 31, 2020, SAMHSA and DEA released <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/dea-samhsa-buprenorphine-telemedicine.pdf" target="_blank">guidance</a> providing flexibility to prescribe buprenorphine to new and existing patients with opioid use disorder via telephone</p>
