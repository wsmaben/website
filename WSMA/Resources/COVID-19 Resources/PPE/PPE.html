      <h2>WSMA Partners with WSHA to Offer Masks</h2>
      <p>
         Many physician practices still face barriers to accessing PPE. The WSMA is partnering with the Washington State Hospital
         Association, and its subsidiary Washington Hospital Services, to supply procedural masks to medical groups and physician practices
         throughout the state. WSHA has been importing and distributing masks to its member hospitals since April and has a secure
         relationship with a supplier who is able to offer them bulk pricing. They have agreed to expand the distribution network to include
         all health care organizations, which will now be able to purchase the masks in small quantities but at the price point of a
         high-volume order. If you have questions about ordering masks, please contact
         <a href="mailto:ValerieA@wsha.org">ValerieA@wsha.org</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>FDA-approved disposable ASTM Level 1 simple procedural masks, non-sterile</h3>
      <p>
         These procedural masks are $0.70 per unit, including delivery. The minimum order quantity is 2,000 masks. Product details are
         available via the order form at the link below (or you can

            >click here to download a pdf with product details and specifications</a
         >). Payment is not due at the time you place your order but will be collected before your order is shipped. Orders will be filled
         on a first-come, first-served basis. Submit your order by 9 a.m. each Monday to be included in that week's distribution. The order
         link will remain live until the supply is depleted.
