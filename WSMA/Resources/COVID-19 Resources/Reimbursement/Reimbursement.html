         During the COVID-19 crisis, sensible reimbursement policies are essential to allow physicians and practices to continue providing preventive,
         acute, and chronic care for their patients, to provide care in a manner that keeps our health care workforce safe, and to protect physician
         practice viability.

         <strong>Here's what you need to know about COVID-19 Reimbursement:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
         <strong>New and updated coding guidance from CMS:</strong> CMS details several new Medicare fee-for-service policies in response to the
         COVID-10 pandemic, including guidance on the appropriate modifiers and place of service codes for billing telehealth services and waiving
         cost-sharing for COVID-19 testing-related services.

      </p>
      <p>
         <strong>Audio-only telehealth services:</strong> CMS has waived the interactive audio-video requirement for certain telehealth evaluation and
         management services, so now providers can bill for these services when provided by audio-only telephone, provided all other applicable
         requirements are met. CMS has updated the list of eligible codes on the
         <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-General-Information/Telehealth/Telehealth-Codes">Medicare telehealth services list</a>
         and clearly marked which codes are eligible for audio-only. You can read the rule

      <p>
         <strong>Payment parity for audio-only telephone codes</strong>: The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) has recognized the
         need to better support audio-only telephone services by increasing payments for telephone visits to match payments for office and outpatient
         visits. CMS has increased payments for these services from a range of about $14-$41 to about $46-$110. The payments are retroactive to March
         1, 2020. CMS has cross-walked payment rates for CPT codes 99212, 99213, and 99214 to 99441, 99442, and 99443. CMS is also finalizing on an
         interim basis and for the duration of the COVID-19 PHE the following work RVUs: 0.48 for CPT code 99441; 0.97 for CPT code 99442; and 1.50
         for CPT code 99443. You can read the rule

         state-regulated plans. However, this change is not applicable to certain self-insured/ERISA plans that are not regulated by the state. Gov.
         Inslee's proclamation is effective through Dec. 7. For the order to be renewed, the governor will need approval from legislative leadership.

            <h3>Medicare</h3>
            <p>
               On April 30, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule that builds on the previous regulatory waivers and flexibilities issued on March
               17, 2020, and March 30, 2020. These temporary waivers and flexibilities remove barriers so healthcare systems and providers can better
               respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.

               the telehealth waivers and other flexibilities, including HIPAA, cost-sharing, and more. It also provides information on billing and
               reimbursement, legal considerations, planning your telehealth workflow, and how to prepare your patients for telehealth.

               physicians and other practitioners that they will not be subject to sanctions for reducing or waiving any cost-sharing obligations that
               beneficiaries may owe for telehealth services (March 17, 2020)

               must: allow a one-time early refill for prescription drugs; suspend prior authorization requirements for treatment or testing of
               COVID-19; and, if an insurer does not have enough medical providers in its network to provide testing and treatment for COVID-19, it
               must allow enrollees to be treated by another provider within a reasonable distance at no additional cost. Read the
