      <h1 class="mobileShow">COVID-19 Vaccines</h1>
      <p>
         COVID-19 vaccines are now being administered in Washington state, with
         allocations of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines at identified
         vaccine provider locations across Washington.
      </p>
      <p>
         The Washington State Department of Health is taking a phased approach
         to vaccine distribution and administration, initially focusing on all
         workers in health care settings. The vaccine is not yet available to
         the public. Learn more below about the state's distribution plan and
         prioritization below.
      </p>
      <p>
         The WSMA continues to hear from members facing hurdles accessing the
         vaccine for their practice and staff. See below for guidance on getting
         your practice vaccinated.

      </h2>
      <p>
         Clinics, pharmacies, and hospitals interested in administering COVID-19
         vaccine must enroll in the federal COVID-19 Vaccination Program. Visit
         the
         <a
            href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/COVID19/HealthcareProviders/VaccineInformationforHealthcareProviders"

      <h2>Guidance for Non-Hospital-Affiliated Outpatient Practices</h2>
      <p>
         All workers in health care settings can now receive the COVID-19
         vaccine under the state's
         <a
            href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/Portals/1/Documents/1600/coronavirus/VaccineAllocationPhase1A.pdf"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >Phase 1A, tiers 1 and 2</a
         >. However, the WSMA continues to hear from members facing hurdles
         accessing the vaccine for their practice and staff. The following
         guidance can help.
      </p>
      <h3>Phase Finder</h3>
      <p>
         The Washington State Department of Health is piloting "Phase Finder," a
         new tool now available for health care workers in Phase 1A, tiers 1 and
         2, that does the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            Assesses eligibility confirmation and provides confirmation that can
            be used at a vaccine administration site in lieu of an official
            letter (note: providers are likely to ask for ID and/or badge).
         </li>
         <li>Identifies where they can go to get vaccinated.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
         To access the tool, go to
         <a href="https://wadoh.jotform.com/203418436942154"
            >findyourphasewa.com</a
         >. Once you get to the final screen, you will find sites where you can
         get vaccinated. Please note: The state has clarified that this is a
         "soft launch" of the tool; in testing, WSMA staff found some of the
         vaccine site information neither complete nor accurate. This is
         especially true for the urban hospitals and the contacts listed. WSMA
         staff also found the tool to be slow; patience, and retries, are
         advised.
      </p>
      <p>
         Phase Finder will launch broadly on Jan. 18. The tool will be available
         in multiple languages and is intended to be used to provide eligibility
         confirmation onsite.
      </p>
      <h3>How the WSMA can help your practice get vaccinated</h3>
      <p>
         If you would like WSMA's help with getting your clinic connected with
         your local hospital, please complete our clinic form, emailed to all
         outpatient, non-hospital-affiliated physicians in our records on
         Wednesday, Jan. 6. We will share your information with your local
         hospital so that you and your staff are vaccinated as soon as possible.
         If you haven't yet received the form, let us know: email
         <a href="mailto:policy@wsma.org">policy@wsma.org</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
         Please note if your practice is in King County: The King County Medical
         Society is also providing assistance for clinics in King County. If you
         are in King County you are welcome to reach out to KCMS directly with
         any questions or concerns at
         <a href="mailto:info@kcmsociety.org">info@kcmsociety.org</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
         We know several county medical societies are also collecting this
         information and coordinating with local public health departments. To
         learn more about what’s happening at your local county medical society,
         reach out to them directly (<a

      <h2>COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution and Prioritization</h2>
      <p>
         Washington is currently in
         <a
            href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/Portals/1/Documents/1600/coronavirus/VaccineAllocationPhase1A.pdf"
            >Phase 1A, tiers 1 and 2</a
         >, of its COVID-19 vaccine allocation, which allows for the vaccination
         of all workers in health care settings once high-risk workers are
         vaccinated.
      </p>
      <p>
         Please note some communities are still working through 1A and others
         will be able to move to this second tier of 1A more quickly. The
         Department of Health has instructed health care systems around the
         state to actively reach out to and provide access to COVID-19
         vaccination for those in the community-based health care workforce
         outside their systems and in their community—this includes other health
         care providers, school nurses, and behavioral health providers—in order
         to complete this phase and ensure we have a protected health care
         system.
      </p>
      <h3>DOH announces Phase 1B</h3>
      <p>
         Department of Health officials have announced details on the next phase
         of COVID-19 vaccinations, Phase 1B, while also committing to redoubling
         efforts to ensure all workers in health care settings in Phase 1A are
         able to get their vaccination.
      </p>
      <p>
         The state made clear in its announcement that it is not moving into
         Phase 1B yet, and that Washington is still in Phase 1A. Details and a
         timeline are being released by the DOH to allow for logistical and
         administrative planning.
      </p>
      <h4>Phase 1B details and timeline</h4>
      <p>
         The state has broken its Phase 1B into four tiers. This next phase is
         based upon the broad guidance provided by the federal Advisory
         Committee on Immunization Practices as well as input from state
         partners and the public.
