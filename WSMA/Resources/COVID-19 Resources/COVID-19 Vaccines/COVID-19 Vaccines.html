      Instilling COVID-19 Vaccine Confidence
    </h2>
    <p>
      The WSMA is joining with health care partners across the state to help
      promote confidence in, and uptake of, life-saving COVID-19 vaccines. Our
      members are the key to our success in this endeavor. By leveraging the
      trust patients have in their physicians, you can help ensure
      Washingtonians are receiving guidance based on sound science and good
      medical practice—and help counter the increasing barrage of misinformation
      circulating on- and offline.
    </p>
    <p>
      The WSMA offers the following resources to help you and your practice or
      organization.
    </p>
    <h3 id="KeyCovid19VaccineMessages">Key COVID-19 vaccine messages</h3>
    <p>
      The WSMA, together with our state and our health partners, are reinforcing
      these key COVID-19 vaccine messages:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>When it’s your turn, don’t hesitate, vaccinate.</li>
      <li>
        All three COVID-19 vaccines are safe and very effective in protecting
        you from serious illness and death.
      </li>
      <li>The best vaccine is the first vaccine that’s available to you.</li>
    </ul>

      The WSMA has produced a new 45-second PSA featuring WSMA President Nathan
      Schlicher, MD, JD, MBA, called “<a
        href="https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/532903768"
        >Don't hesitate, just vaccinate!</a
      >” The WSMA will be disseminating this video widely. You can help by
      posting on your social channels, embedding on your company website
      (embedding and closed captions are enabled), or sharing the URL with your
      networks.

      Concerns around COVID-19 vaccines’ safety and efficacy are some of the top
      barriers to vaccination. In a recent Washington State Department of Health
      webinar, WSMA members Bob Lutz, MD, from the Department of Health’s
      COVID-19 Response Team, and John H Vassall MD, physician executive for
      quality, safety &amp; equity at Comagine Health, shared best practices for

          The Washington State Department of Health, in partnership with our
          health profession boards and commissions, has made it easier for
          retired health care workers or those with inactive licenses to get
          back into the workforce and help administer the COVID-19 vaccine. On
          Jan. 31, Secretary of Health Dr. Umair Shah signed the
          <a
            href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/Portals/1/Documents/1600/coronavirus/PREP-act-authorization-vaccination-program.pdf"
            >Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (PREP Act)
            authorization</a
          >, allowing workers with expired or inactive licenses to administer
          COVID-19 vaccines under certain circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
          To participate, health care workers must first register
          <a href="https://www.waserv.org/">WAserv.org</a>. Check the Department
          of Health's&nbsp;<a
            href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/COVID19/HealthcareProviders"
            >health care provider resource page</a

          for a registration guide, which provides step-by-step instructions for
          navigating WAserv.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before registering, participants will need to have access to their
          previous Washington state credential numbers, which may be obtained
          through the Department of Health’s
          <a href="https://fortress.wa.gov/doh/providercredentialsearch/"
            >Provider Credential Search</a
          >. The Department of Health will also be checking out of state
          credentials for any disciplinary history.
        </p>
        <p>
          After registering, participants must wait to receive confirmation from
          the Department of Health that they are authorized to administer
          COVID-19 vaccines under Dr. Shah’s authorization. For more details
          about WAserve, be sure to review the FAQs linked to from the WAserve

          Everyone 16 and older who wants a COVID-19 vaccine will be eligible to
          receive one in Washington state starting April 15. The state’s phased
          eligibility approach has helped ensure those most vulnerable were the
          first to be vaccinated, including older adults, those in long term
          care facilities, critical health care workers, and more.
