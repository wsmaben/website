      <h1 class="mobileShow">COVID-19 Vaccines</h1>
      <p>
         COVID-19 vaccines are now on the ground in Washington state, with initial allocations of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on their way to
         selected health care facilities and FDA authorization expected for a Moderna vaccine shortly. The WSMA continues to work closely with the
         state to help inform their efforts, including providing input on the state's interim COVID-19 Vaccination Plan, hosting public health leaders
         and physician experts in our member education efforts, and coordinating with health care stakeholders to help instill confidence in the
         safety and efficacy of the vaccines and ensure successful and equitable distribution and administration.
      </p>
      <h2>COVID-19 Scientific Safety Review Workgroup</h2>
      <p>
         The
         <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Scientific-Safety-Review-Workgroup.aspx"
            >COVID-19 Scientific Safety Review Workgroup</a
         >, which includes Washington, Oregon, Nevada, Colorado, and California, reviews the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines when approved by
         the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. State officials believe this added layer of independent expert review will help build confidence in
         the vaccine. Washington's representatives on the work group include Edgar Marcus, MD, University of Washington, and John Dunn, MD, Kaiser
         Permanente Washington.
      </p>
      <h2>Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine</h2>
      <p>
         On Dec. 12, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for use of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in persons aged 16 and older. The
         Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices also voted to recommend this vaccine for use in persons aged 16 and older for the prevention of
         COVID-19.
      </p>
      <p>
         The Scientific Safety Review Workgroup, which includes Washington, Oregon, Nevada, Colorado, and California, met Dec. 10 and 11 to review the
         safety and efficacy data for the vaccine. The 17-member work group voted unanimously to recommend the vaccine for immediate use.

      <h2>COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution and Prioritization</h2>
      <p>
         The Washington State Department of Health released Phase 1A of the COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Guidance on Dec 10. Phase 1A focuses on
         vaccinating two groups:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>High-risk workers in health care settings and high-risk first responders.</li>
         <li>
            Residents and staff of nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and other community-based, congregate living settings where people over
            65 are getting care or assistance.
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
         The DOH estimates around 500,000 people in Washington will be eligible for the vaccine in phase 1A. For more specific information, please see
         the

            >WA State COVID-19 Allocation Guidance for Phase 1A PDF</a
         >. The DOH will make decisions on who will be vaccinated in later phases based on guidance made by the CDC's Advisory Committee on
         Immunization Practices.
      </p>
      <p>
         For an overview of the state's vaccine distribution plan, see the Washington State Interim COVID-19 Vaccination Plan available
         <a href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/COVID19/Vaccine">on the DOH website</a>. The plan is a living document and will change over time
         as we learn more about the vaccines and figure out the most equitable way to protect people.
      </p>
      <h3>Feedback on state vaccine prioritization</h3>
      <p>
         The Department of Health is continually gathering feedback on the COVID-19 vaccination process.
         <a href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/COVID19/VaccineInformation/Engagement">Visit the DOH website</a> to learn more about engagement
         efforts and how to provide feedback.
      </p>
      <h3>Action items for outpatient practices</h3>
      <p>
         The DOH recommends that outpatient practices not affiliated with a hospital enroll as a COVID-19 vaccine provider as soon as possible.
         <a href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/COVID19/HealthcareProviders/VaccineInformationforHealthcareProviders"
            >Complete enrollment information is available here</a
         >. According to the DOH, enrollment will allow practices to get the vaccine directly and administer it to their patients and staff. For
         clinics needing less than 100 doses, the DOH recommends partnering with another practice nearby for the purposes of vaccinating staff.
      </p>
      <p>
         Some hospitals will be setting up "pods" to vaccinate outpatient workers. Hospitals operating a pod will be required to designate themselves
         as such. Reach out to your local hospital today to learn about their plans for vaccinating outpatient health care workers.
