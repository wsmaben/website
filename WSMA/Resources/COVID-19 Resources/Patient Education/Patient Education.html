        <h3>Costs for COVID-19 testing</h3>
        <p>
          If you have insurance and are symptomatic, there should be no cost to
          you as a patient for the COVID-19 lab test. Patients who do not have
          insurance should ask their physician or provider about using the HRSA
          portal to bill for the test:

          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Washington State Health Care Authority is working with insurance
          carriers across all the populations they purchase for, including
          Medicaid (Apple Health), public employees and school employees, to
          waive the costs association with COVID-19 testing.
