			<p><strong>It's a good time to have the conversation&mdash;while you are still able&mdash;on how you want to live near the end of your life so your wishes can be honored when the time comes.</strong></p>
			<p>Honoring Choices&reg; Pacific Northwest is your resource to start the conversation and make a personal plan for your end-of-life care. Do it for the ones you love. Do it for yourself.</p>
