      <h1 class="mobileShow">WSMA Guidance: LGBT Health</h1>
      <p>
         At the 2014 WSMA Annual Meeting, the House of Delegates adopted Resolution B-14 &ndash; Health Care Access and Inequities in
         Persons Who Are Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender. This resolution was introduced to identify ways to address disparities
         faced by individuals who are, or may be, LGBT, or who may have issues concerning gender identity or sex development. Such
         disparities may include "decreased access to needed care, bias and discrimination &hellip; lack of [health care] provider knowledge
         and/or comfort in providing care, absent or suboptimal risk factor assessment, and medical management that is not grounded in the
         current best evidence." (See AAMC paper described below, p. 55.) Such disparities create the potential for "preventable harm."
      </p>
      <p>
         At the 2019 WSMA Annual Meeting, the House of Delegates adopted Resolution C-24 &ndash; Improving Health Care Experiences for
         Transgender and Gender Nonconforming Patients. This resolution declares WSMA's strong support for the rights of transgender and
         gender nonconforming patients, and recommends that all Washington state health care facilities that provide direct patient care
         adopt gender-affirming practices, including but not limited to the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>Ensure appropriate documentation of a patient's preferred name and pronouns as part of new patient registration processes.</li>
         <li>Establish and publicize protocol for documenting a change in a patient's gender.</li>
         <li>Provide a write-in option for sex and gender on all forms and avoid binary identifiers.</li>
         <li>Offer gender sensitivity training by an expert trainer for all medical providers, administrators, and support staff.</li>
         <li>
            Develop guidelines for providing appropriate preventative health care screenings for all patients regardless of gender identity
            and according to their physical needs.
         </li>
         <li>Ensure the availability of gender-neutral bathrooms.</li>
         <li>
            Develop a patient referral plan when one's health care facility is unable to provide gender-affirming services, including
            hormone replacement therapy, gender-affirming surgical procedures, and routine preventative health screening.
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
         The WSMA is committed to helping physicians offer care that is complete and welcoming for all patients. In reviewing information
         related to this important topic, we have identified several of the most effective, yet easy to institute, ways for physicians to
         welcome their LGBT patients. As such, and at the directive of the Resolution B-14 from 2014 and C-24 from 2019, the WSMA is
         providing resources for physicians to make their practice more responsive to the needs of LGBT patients. This includes materials on
         concise terminology regarding LGBT individuals, the unique medical needs of LBGT patients, cultural competency, LGBT-sensitive
         language for forms and paperwork, and suggestions for ways to make your practice more welcoming for all.

         <strong>Updated June 2020</strong>
      </p>
      <h3>Terminology</h3>
      <p>
         The proper use of relevant terminology fosters effective communication in general and is crucially important in matters related to
         sexual orientation and gender. We have listed below several resources that provide a glossary of helpful terms related to the LGBT
         community:
      </p>

         </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Promoting a safe and welcoming waiting room for LGBT patients</h3>
      <p>
         LGBT patients often experience barriers to care because of their sexual orientation or gender identity/expression. Fear of
         discrimination and prejudice may make it difficult for LGBT patients to confide in their doctor, ask questions, or even seek
         treatment. You can take steps to show your patients that they can expect superior treatment in a safe environment.
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>Consider providing gender-neutral facilities, such as single-occupant or "family" designated restrooms.</li>
         <li>
            You may want to sign up to be included in the provider referral programs offered by LGBT organizations, such as the
            <a href="http://www.glma.org/">Gay and Lesbian Medical Association</a>. This program allows potential patients to search for
            providers (such as primary care providers, specialists, therapists, dentists, and other health professionals) by region. Making
            sure you are included in these databases sends a clear signal to LGBT patients that you are going to provide sensitive care in a
            welcoming environment.
         </li>
         <li>
            Update intake forms and other paperwork to make sure that they reflect appropriate options for all patients. You can view a
            sample intake form provided by the
            <a href="http://www.lgbthealtheducation.org/wp-content/uploads/Handout_2-B_References.pdf" target="_blank"
               >National LGBT Health Education Center online</a
            >.
         </li>
         <li>
            If appropriate, consider using posters showing racially and ethnically diverse same-sex couples or transgender people. Often,
            local non-profit LGBT or HIV/AIDS organizations have these kinds of materials already prepared and are willing to provide them
            for your use.
         </li>
         <li>
            Stock your waiting room with brochures that discuss diverse health concerns, such as breast cancer, safe sex, hormone therapy,
            mental health, substance use, and sexually transmitted diseases/infections.
         </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Detailed LGBT resources for physicians</h3>
      <h4>Joint Commission</h4>
      <p>
         The Joint Commission provides a wide range of valuable information in its publication,
         <a href="https://www.jointcommission.org/lgbt/"
            >Advancing Effective Communication, Cultural Competence, and Patient- and Family-Centered Care</a
         >. The Joint Commission guide can be used both as an organizational self-assessment tool and as an educational resource.

      <ul>
         <li>The role of leadership in establishing a welcoming culture in medical practice.</li>

      </ul>
      <h4>Association of American Medical Colleges</h4>
      <p>
         The Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) in 2014 released
         <a href="https://www.aamc.org/download/414172/data/lgbt.pdf" target="_blank"
            >guidelines on training physicians to treat LGBT patients</a
         >, produced by the AAMC Advisory Committee on Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity, and Sex Development, which includes 30
         competencies the AAMC recommends physicians learn. Make sure you and your staff are up to date on this information.
      </p>
      <p>
         The AAMC guidelines, while designed for use in medical schools, are nonetheless vitally important for established physicians to
         incorporate into their practices. The guidelines provide information on important competency objectives to improve health care for
         individuals who are or may be LGBT, gender non-conforming, and/or are born with differences of sex development in each of eight
         domains:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>Patient Care</li>
         <li>Knowledge for Practice</li>
         <li>Practice-Based Learning and Improvement</li>
         <li>Interpersonal and Communication Skills</li>
         <li>Professionalism</li>
         <li>Systems-Based Practice</li>
         <li>Interprofessional Collaboration</li>
         <li>Personal and Professional Development</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
         In addition to describing these competencies, the AAMC paper also discusses integration of those competencies into medical school
         curricula, and many other issues of importance.
      </p>
      <h4>American Medical Association</h4>
      <p>
         The American Medical Association has a webpage, "<a

         The Center of Excellence for Transgender Health, affiliated with the University of California, San Francisco, serves "to increase

         comprised of 14 recognized leaders in the transgender community. The center's staff includes a comprehensive medical advisory
         board. The <a href="http://transhealth.ucsf.edu/">center's website</a> is another great resource for physicians on a number of
