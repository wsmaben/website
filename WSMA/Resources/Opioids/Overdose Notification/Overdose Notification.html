		<h1 class="mobileShow">Overdose Notification</h1>
		<p><strong>Giving physicians timely information to coordinate prescribing, support treatment interventions, and stop overdose deaths.</strong></p>
		<h2>About the overdose notification program</h2>
		<p>The WSMA, the Washington State Department of Health and the Washington State Hospital Association have partnered with Collective Medical, developers of the Emergency Department Information Exchange (EDIE), to launch an overdose notification program, with a statewide rollout expected in 2019.</p>
		<p>This new system, currently being piloted in Clallam and Jefferson counties, will notify a primary care physician or any other prescribing provider when their patient is brought to a hospital emergency department and confirmed to have experienced an overdose. The goal of this program is to give providers timely information to coordinate prescribing, support treatment interventions, and stop overdose deaths.</p>
		<h3>Learn more</h3>
		<p>Physicians and providers need timely and meaningful information to support patient care. This notification program uses the EDIE platform to share critical information with providers, nearly in real time. The pilot will last for three months and then spread to the rest of the state at no cost to hospitals, physicians or providers.</p>
		<p>The WSMA worked with WSHA, DOH and Collective Medical Technology to advance legislation (HB 1427) in 2017 to establish this program. We have been working collaboratively over the past year to build the infrastructure, and we are excited to finally pilot the program and expand it in the coming months.</p>
