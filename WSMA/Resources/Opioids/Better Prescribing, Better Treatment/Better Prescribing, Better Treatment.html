      <p>
         The Better Prescribing, Better Treatment (BPBT) program is a
         peer-to-peer, clinician-driven quality improvement program that
         promotes safe, appropriate prescribing to curb opioid misuse and
         overdose. The program was developed in partnership with the Washington
         State Hospital Association and the state Health Care Authority in lieu
         of proposals seeking to implement mandatory prior authorization for all
         opioid prescriptions. At the same time, the legislature was considering
         a blunt statutory 7-day pill limit that would have been problematic for
         appropriate patient care and potentially result in disciplinary action
         for well-meaning clinicians.
      </p>
      <p>
         BPBT was launched to focus on quality improvement rather than punitive
         regulatory oversight. This effort has protected the medical profession
         from further problematic legislative and/or regulatory interference,
         while significantly improving opioid prescribing behaviors and
         resulting patient care and outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
         BPBT is a component of the
         <a
            href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/Portals/1/Documents/1000/140-182-StateOpioidResponsePlan.pdf"

            rel="noreferrer"
            >state opioid response plan</a
         >, and is a collaboration between the Washington State Medical
         Association, Washington State Hospital Association, Washington State
         Department of Health, and the Washington State Health Care Authority.
      </p>
      <p>The BPBT program promotes safe prescribing in two ways:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <strong>Washington State Opioid Prescribing Reports:</strong> Each
            quarter, the WSMA sends prescribers in the state an opioid
            prescribing feedback report. Using data from the state prescription
            monitoring program (PMP), the report shows how their opioid
            prescribing practices compare to others in their hospital, health
            system, or medical group, as well as within their specialty. To
            participate, prescribers are opted-in by their organization's CMO.
         </li>
         <li>
            <strong>Opioid Management Coaching Program:</strong> In partnership
            with the University of Washington Six Building Blocks program, the
            WSMA offers coaching services on improving systems in primary care
            clinics to deliver more evidence-based chronic pain care and opioid
            management. Contact
            <a href="mailto:monica@wsma.org">monica@wsma.org</a> for more
            information.
         </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Washington State Opioid Prescribing Reports</h2>
      <h3>Results Driven</h3>
      <p>
         Better Prescribing, Better Treatment's data-driven and data-sharing
         approach is working. The initiative, now encompassing 15,000+
         prescribers with 60 hospitals, health systems, and medical groups in
         the state. Collectively, reducing opioid prescriptions above guidelines
         by 40% since the program's inception in late 2017.
      </p>
      <h3>To opt In</h3>
      <p>
         If you prescribe opioids in Washington state and your organization has
         yet to enroll to receive Washington State Opioid Prescribing Reports,
         your CMO can email
         <a href="mailto:opioidreports@wsma.org">opioidreports@wsma.org</a> to
         enroll. Minimal resources and administrative time are required.
