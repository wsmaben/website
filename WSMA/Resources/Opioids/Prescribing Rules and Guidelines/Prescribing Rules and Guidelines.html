		<h1 class="mobileShow">Prescribing Rules and Guidelines</h1>
		<p><strong>New rules governing opioid prescribing are now in effect for most prescribing professions in Washington state, including physicians and physician assistants, prompted by House Bill 1427 from 2017. Information on these state requirements, plus links to state and federal opioid prescribing guidelines, below.</strong></p>
		<h2>Washington state opioid prescribing rules</h2>
		<p>New rules governing opioid prescribing, prompted by <a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=1427&amp;Year=2017&amp;Initiative=false">House Bill 1427</a> from 2017, are now in effect in Washington state. The comprehensive rules represent a significant change in how opioids are prescribed. Key provisions applicable to all prescribing physicians and PAs include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A seven-day pill limit for acute prescriptions and 14 days for acute operative pain, with an exemption to these limits when clinical judgment is documented in the medical record.</li>
			<li>A specific care plan and documentation requirements for each phase of pain.</li>
			<li>Mandated registration and targeted checks of the prescription drug monitoring program.</li>
			<li>Required continuing medical education on opioid prescribing.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The prescribing boards and commissions for MDs, DOs, and PAs offer more information and resources on the new rules in effect:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The Washington Medical Commission <a href="https://wmc.wa.gov/resources/pain-management-resources">rules overview and resources</a> and <a href="https://wmc.wa.gov/sites/default/files/public/documents/Ruleswithcoverpage.pdf" target="_blank">rule text</a>.</li>
			<li>Washington State Board of Osteopathic Medicine and Surgery <a href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/LicensesPermitsandCertificates/ProfessionsNewReneworUpdate/OsteopathicPhysician">rules overview and resources</a> and <a href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/Portals/1/Documents/2300/2018/WSR-18-20-087.pdf" target="_blank">rule text</a>.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Prescribing clinicians are advised to review this <a href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/Portals/1/Documents/631073-OverviewHandout-Pharmacy.pdf?ver=2018-10-04-151450-403">table of differences</a> from the Department of Health to understand the differing requirements between Medical Commission and osteopathic board rulemaking.</p>
		<h3>Opioid prescribing rule amendments effective February 2020</h3>
		<p>Washington's prescribing boards and commissions have adopted amendments to their opioid prescribing rules to comply with <a href="http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2019-20/Pdf/Bills/Session%2520Laws/Senate/5380-S.SL.pdf?q=20200227095305">Senate Bill 5380</a> from the 2019 state legislative session. New requirements include patient notification of the risks of prescription opioids, including the risk of dependence and overdose, pain management alternatives to opioids, when clinically appropriate, evidence-based alternatives exist, and notification to the patient that they have the right to refuse an opioid prescription for any reason.</p>
		<p>
			Review the adopted amendments, which also identify situations where the notification requirements would not apply:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://wmc.wa.gov/sites/default/files/rules/CR-103.pdf" target="_blank">Washington Medical Commission rule amendments</a></li>
			<li><a href="javascript://[Uploaded files/News and Publications/Newsletters/2020/CR103_Final.pdf]">Washington State Board of Osteopathic Medicine and Surgery rule amendments</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p>Medical Commission rule amendments are effective starting Feb. 29, 2020; osteopathic board rule amendments Feb. 21, 2020. These new requirements must be documented in the medical record when applicable. To help you successfully incorporate these new requirements into your workflow, the WSMA has updated its Epic-compatible pain management rule requirements checklist, available below.</p>
