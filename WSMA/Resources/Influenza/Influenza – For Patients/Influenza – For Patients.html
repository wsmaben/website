		<p>
			<strong>Getting your flu shot at the beginning of the fall respiratory illness season is an easy and safe way to reduce your risk of getting the flu and reduce your risk of needing flu-related medical care, which will conserve scarce medical resources for care of COVID-19 patients.</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>This year, be safe, be sure, and get your flu shot.</strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>When to get your flu shot</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			Health officials recommend getting your flu shot in September and October this year to provide the fullest protection from the flu&mdash;and to help prevent a health system surge.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Where to get your flu shot</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			Vaccination in consultation with your physician is always ideal, to ensure that you and your family are receiving other preventive services that may have been deferred during the COVID-19 pandemic.
		</p>
		<p>This year, however, with new options being made available due to the pandemic, what's most important is that you get vaccinated in a manner convenient for you and your family. Flu vaccines are increasingly available in local pharmacies, in flu pop-up clinics, and physician offices and clinics. At each location, staff are prepared to see you and are taking every precaution to ensure your safety. To find a vaccine near you, visit <a href="https://vaccinefinder.org">vaccinefinder.org</a>.</p>
		<p>
			<strong>"I'm wearing a mask and social distancing, so I don't need a flu shot"</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			It's important this fall for patients not to get complacent, even with social distancing and masks. Flu can be unpredictable, and there's a lot we don't know about the upcoming flu season. We strongly urge you to get your flu shot as early as possible.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>The flu can be very serious&mdash;and a vaccine is available</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			Flu is a very serious illness. Its symptoms will likely create a lot of anxiety in patients because of their similarity to those of COVID-19. While we don't yet have a COVID-19 vaccine, the flu vaccine is here and it's available. For most people, a flu vaccine will take one virus off the table, giving you one less thing to worry about.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Flu + COVID-19 = double trouble for our health care system</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			If both viruses are circulating in our communities unchecked, there could be an enormous strain on our ability to test, diagnose, and devote limited resources like hospital beds. Reducing flu through vaccinations will help reduce the number of flu patients in our health care system&mdash;and help better detect and manage COVID-19 in our communities.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Protect yourself&mdash;and protect others</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			Getting your flu shot not only protects you, but it protects others, especially those who are more vulnerable, including infants, seniors, and those with chronic medical conditions. If more people get vaccinated early, the more we can prevent the flu from spreading throughout the community.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>"I can't afford a flu shot"</strong>
		</p>
		<p>Most flu shots are free. All children in Washington may receive a flu vaccine at no cost through age 18. It's also covered by most insurance plans for adults, and by Medicaid and Medicare part B. The Department of Health is offering free flu vaccines for the uninsured and underinsured. Visit <a href="https://vaccinefinder.org/">vaccinefinder.org</a> to find your nearest vaccine provider.</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Fight the flu&mdash;and keep fighting COVID-19</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			We must not get complacent with either the flu or COVID-19&mdash;so get your flu shot, keep wearing your mask, and keep social distancing.
		</p>
