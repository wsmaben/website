      Getting your flu shot at the beginning of the fall respiratory illness
      season is an easy and safe way to reduce your risk of getting the flu and
      reduce your risk of needing flu-related medical care, which will conserve
      scarce medical resources for care of COVID-19 patients.
    </p>
    <p>This year, be safe, be smart, and get your flu shot.</p>

    <p>
      <strong>When to get your flu shot</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Health officials recommend getting your flu shot as soon as possible to
      provide the fullest protection from the flu—and to help prevent a health
      system surge.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Where to get your flu shot</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Vaccination in consultation with your physician is always ideal, to ensure
      that you and your family are receiving other preventive services that may
      have been deferred during the COVID-19 pandemic.
    </p>
    <p>
      This year, however, with new options being made available due to the
      pandemic, what's most important is that you get vaccinated in a manner
      convenient for you and your family. Flu vaccines are increasingly
      available in local pharmacies, in flu pop-up clinics, and physician
      offices and clinics. At each location, staff are prepared to see you and
      are taking every precaution to ensure your safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      To find a flu vaccine near you, call your doctor or local pharmacy, or
      visit
      <a href="https://www.vaccinefinder.org">www.vaccinefinder.org</a>.
    </p>
    <!-- !NEW VIDEO******************************************************** -->

    <p>
      <strong>Most flu shots are covered</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Flu vaccine for those age 19 and older is covered by most insurance
      companies and by Medicare and Apple Health (Medicaid). Washington state
      also provides flu vaccine, and all recommended vaccines, at no cost to
      everyone under the age of 19.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Flu vaccine now available for uninsured adults</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Department of Health is collaborating with Safeway and Albertsons to
      offer free flu vaccinations for uninsured adults. Twenty-three Albertsons
      and Safeway pharmacies across the state will offer flu vaccine free of
      charge through June 2021. The pharmacies will not charge an administration
      fee, and no proof of residency or immigration status will be required.

      <strong

        shot"</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      It's important this fall for patients not to get complacent, even with
      social distancing and masks. Flu can be unpredictable, and there's a lot
      we don't know about the upcoming flu season. We strongly urge you to get
      your flu shot as early as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>The flu can be very serious—and a vaccine is available</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Flu is a very serious illness. Its symptoms will likely create a lot of
      anxiety in patients because of their similarity to those of COVID-19.
      While we don't yet have a COVID-19 vaccine, the flu vaccine is here and
      it's available. For most people, a flu vaccine will take one virus off the
      table, giving you one less thing to worry about.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Flu + COVID-19 = double trouble for our health care system</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      If both viruses are circulating in our communities unchecked, there could
      be an enormous strain on our ability to test, diagnose, and devote limited
      resources like hospital beds. Reducing flu through vaccinations will help
      reduce the number of flu patients in our health care system—and help
      better detect and manage COVID-19 in our communities.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Protect yourself—and protect others</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Getting your flu shot not only protects you, but it protects others,
      especially those who are more vulnerable, including infants, seniors, and
      those with chronic medical conditions. If more people get vaccinated
      early, the more we can prevent the flu from spreading throughout the
      community.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Fight the flu—and keep fighting COVID-19</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      We must not get complacent with either the flu or COVID-19—so get your flu
      shot, keep wearing your mask, and keep social distancing.
    </p>
    <h3>Flu vaccines in brief</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Each year, the flu vaccine protects against those flu viruses that
        research indicates will be most common during the upcoming season.
      </li>
      <li>Flu vaccines cannot cause flu.</li>
      <li>
        Flu vaccines are safe. The most common side effect is a little soreness
        from the injection.
      </li>
      <li>
        Flu vaccine prevents millions of illnesses and flu-related doctor's
        visits each year. During 2018-2019, flu vaccination prevented an
        estimated:

        <ul>
          <li>4.4 million influenza illnesses</li>
          <li>2.3 million influenza-associated medical visits</li>
          <li>58,000 influenza-associated hospitalizations</li>
          <li>3,500 influenza-associated deaths.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Flu vaccination is an important preventive tool for people with chronic
        health conditions.
      </li>
      <li>Flu vaccination helps protect women during and after pregnancy.</li>
      <li>Flu vaccine can be lifesaving in children.</li>
      <li>
        Flu vaccination may reduce severity of illness in people who get
        vaccinated but still get sick.
      </li>
    </ul>
