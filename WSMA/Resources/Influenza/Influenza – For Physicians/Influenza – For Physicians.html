         During the 2020-21 influenza season, with the state still working to slow the spread of the novel respiratory virus SARS-CoV-2,
         it’s more important than ever for Washingtonians to get their flu shot.

      <h3>Be Safe. Be Smart. Get Your Flu Shot. campaign</h3>
      <p>
         Facing a “twindemic” of flu and COVID-19, the WSMA has launched its <em>Be Safe. Be Smart. Get Your Flu Shot. </em>patient
         awareness campaign. The campaign initially focused on early vaccination, with

         The WSMA has now introduced dedicated campaign webpages at <a href="https://wsma.org/flu">wsma.org/flu</a>. Our
         <a href="[@]WSMA/Resources/Influenza/Influenza_For_Patients/influenza_for_patients.aspx">patient page</a> features a vaccine finder
         to help patients find vaccines near them and messaging emphasizing the importance of getting vaccinated during the pandemic. Our
         professional page will features up-to-date flu vaccine information from the Department of Health, as well as professional and
         patient resources for physician practices.

      <h4>Media and public service announcements</h4>
      <p>
         In the weeks ahead, together with more targeted media outreach statewide, the WSMA will produce a series of 30-second public
         service announcements featuring WSMA members speaking directly to their patients, leveraging the trust patients have in their
         family doctors. We’ll post these PSAs throughout our digital channels, as well as distribute to our partners.

      <h3>DOH flu toolkit for your practice</h3>
      <p>
         The Washington State Department of Health received federal funding through the CARES Act to enhance the state's annual seasonal flu
         prevention efforts. With these funds, the Department of Health launched the Think of It as Essential campaign in mid-September to
         promote the importance of making the choice to get a flu vaccine this year. As a supplement to the statewide campaign, the DOH
         offers a partner toolkit, developed with input from the WSMA, which includes patient education materials in both English and
         Spanish, targeting older adults (65 and older), people at higher risk for flu complications, school/parents, health care workers.
