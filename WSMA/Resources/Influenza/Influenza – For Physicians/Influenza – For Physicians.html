		<p>
			<strong>During the 2020-21 influenza season, with the state still working to slow the spread of the novel respiratory virus SARS-CoV-2, it’s more important than ever for Washingtonians to get their flu shot.</strong>

		<h3>Flu toolkit for your practice</h3>
		<p>
			The Washington State Department of Health will launch its updated flu campaign in September. The final touches are being put on a partner toolkit—companion materials (In English and Spanish) for immunization partners to promote through their own communication channels. The WSMA will participate in a rapid review of the partner materials for equity or best practice issues and will publish them on this page and promote in our communication channels when ready.
