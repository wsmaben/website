         During the 2020-21 influenza season, with the state still working to slow the spread of the novel respiratory virus SARS-CoV-2, it's more
         important than ever for Washingtonians to get their flu shot.

         The WSMA's <em>Be Safe Be Smart Get Your Flu Shot</em> patient awareness campaign is designed to help the physician community increase flu
         vaccination uptake by leveraging the physician voice as the most trusted source of health information for patients. Our

         patients find vaccines near them and messaging emphasizing the importance of getting vaccinated during the pandemic. Our professional page
         features up-to-date flu vaccine information from the Department of Health, as well as professional and patient resources for physician
         practices.
