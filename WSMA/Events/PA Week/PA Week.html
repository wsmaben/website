<h1 class="mobileShow">PA Week</h1>
<p>Every year from Oct. 6-12, we celebrate National PA Week, which recognizes the physician assistant profession and its contributions to the nation’s health. Physician assistants are crucial members of care teams throughout Washington—and at the WSMA, they make up a vital element of our membership.
</p>
<p>Before it was a weeklong event, National PA Day was first celebrated on Oct. 6, 1987 in honor of the 20th anniversary of the first graduating class of PAs. Oct. 6 is also the birthday of the profession’s founder Eugene A. Stead Jr., MD. [Washington state was an early adopter of PAs, with the WSMA providing crucial support to help pass legislation in 1971 allowing PA practice in the state. The WSMA invited PAs to join as members in 1982].
</p>
<p>This PA Week is especially significant as it falls during a global pandemic. PAs have stepped up in major ways, including serving on the front lines of the COVID-19 response. Whatever your specialty or setting, you have put your health at risk every day to care for your patients.
</p>
<p>During this challenging time, PAs have not only proven themselves as flexible, adaptable, and collaborative—but also essential. Essential to health care. Essential to patients.</p>
