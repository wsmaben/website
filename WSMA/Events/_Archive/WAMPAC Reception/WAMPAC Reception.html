   Tuesday, Oct. 6. We're pleased to be joined by
   <a href="https://www.governor.wa.gov/">Gov. Jay Inslee</a>
   , who will provide an update on the state's pandemic response and work in the
   health policy arena before taking questions from attendees. We'll also be
   awarding the WSMA Legislator of the Year to retiring
   <a href="https://randibecker.src.wastateleg.org/">
      Sen. Randi Becker (R-Olympia)
   </a>

   physician community during her legislative tenure. And we'll be joined by
   state House candidate
   <a href="https://www.trushing.org/">Tracy Rushing, MD</a>
   (D-White Salmon) to get her perspective on running for office as a physician
   during the pandemic.
