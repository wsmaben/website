    <h2>
      2019 WEOLC Annual Meeting, <br />
      Nov. 15 in Seattle
    </h2>
    The 2019 WEOLC Annual Meeting provides an excellent opportunity to network with colleagues who share a passionate interest in the full
    journey of planning for end of life and after. This year’s theme is
    <strong>“Before, During and After: Planful Death and Dying in Washington State.”</strong>
    Our sessions will address:
    <ul>
      <li>The latest thinking on advance directives overall, plus planning for those with dementia.</li>
      <li>Reimagining death through stories and visuals featuring home funerals and green burials.</li>
      <li>
        New options for disposition of the body via Washington’s landmark 2019 legislation on human composting as well as alkaline
        hydrolysis cremation.
      </li>
      <li>Several regional authors addressing end of life topics as well as short literary pieces about death, dying and grief.</li>
      <li>A passionate personal story on the importance of leaving a legacy.</li>
      <li>
        A bonus POLST intensive to give clinicians—physicians and other members of the heath care team—the skills they need to improve their
        use of POLST.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The Washington End-of-Life Coalition (WEOLC) is a broad-based cross-section of individuals and organizations across the state
      interested in improving care at the end of life. Co-sponsored by the WSMA and the Washington State Hospital Association, WEOLC
      provides support for Washington's POLST program as well as outreach and networking opportunities through its annual meeting each fall.

          The Annual Meeting of the WSMA House of Delegates (or the WSMA Annual Meeting) is the WSMA's premiere policy-making event, when
          the approximately 200 voting members of the WSMA House of Delegates gather to debate and determine policy for the association,
          elect officers and network with colleagues. All are welcome to attend the WSMA Annual Meeting and take advantage of the
          educational offerings, network and learn more about the association.
        </p>
        <p>
          All legislative power of the WSMA—including the power to alter, amend or repeal the bylaws—is vested in the House of Delegates.
          All business of the House is conducted according to parliamentary procedures as outlined in “The Standard Code of Parliamentary
          Procedure.” The speaker of the House serves as parliamentarian. The speaker of the House is Deborah Harper, MD, of Spokane. The
          vice speaker of the House is Matthew Grierson, MD, of Seattle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Policymaking at the meeting is primarily driven by resolutions. A resolution is a proposal asking the WSMA to take a position or
          act on an issue.

        </p>
        <h3>How the House of Delegates operates</h3>
        <p>
          The House convenes its opening session on Saturday morning of the WSMA Annual Meeting. At this time, guests are invited to speak
          to the delegates and all reports and resolutions are referred to reference committees. This is followed by meetings of the
          reference committees on Saturday.
        </p>
        <p>
          The House holds a second session on Sunday morning. The reference committees present their reports for consideration by the House
          on Sunday.
        </p>

          <a href="javascript://[Uploaded files/Events/Annual Meeting/WSMA_2019_DelDuties-Update.pdf]">Learn more about delegate duties</a>
          .
        </p>
        <h3>Reference committees</h3>
        <p>
          The in-person reference committees scheduled at the WSMA Annual Meeting are the key to the deliberations of the House of
          Delegates. Members of the House and individual members of the WSMA are invited and encouraged to attend these meetings to discuss
          and debate reports and resolutions due to be considered by the House for action.
        </p>
        <p>Each reference committee is made of three members of the House appointed by the speaker and vice speaker.</p>
        <p>
          The chair of the reference committee has the prerogative to permit non-members of the WSMA to present testimony. Committee
          meetings are open to the press.
        </p>
        <p>
          When offering testimony before the reference committee, or on the floor of the House, please identify yourself and the society or
          organization which you represent. It is helpful, unless raising a point of order or asking a question, if you indicate you are
          speaking in favor of, or in opposition to, the resolution or report under discussion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember, the reference committee is the most appropriate place for you to express your opinions and those of your constituents.
          Discussion on the floor of the House on Sunday is generally in response to the recommendations made by the reference committee and
          is not intended as a replay of more extensive testimony given at the committee hearings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most reference committees complete their business in two to three hours on Saturday. The committee reports are published under the
          direction of the speaker and vice speaker and are available on the WSMA website by Saturday evening and in hard copy by 7 a.m. on
          Sunday.
        </p>
        <h3>Virtual reference committees and general discussion forum</h3>
        <p>
          The WSMA offers password-protected online reference committees for those members who aren't able to attend the in-person reference
          committees, or who wish to review and discuss resolutions prior to the WSMA Annual Meeting. The WSMA also offers a general
          discussion forum, also available year-round, for members to develop their policy ideas or start a discussion on any general topic.
          <a href="../[@]WSMA/Membership/Discussion_Forums/Reference_Committees_and_General_Forum.aspx">Learn more about these forums</a>.
