    <p>
      Connect with more than 250 anticipated attendees! The 2021 WSMA Annual
      Meeting is expected to garner additional interest and participation
      because it is our first in-person event in nearly two years.
    </p>
    <p>
      The exhibit space is directly outside the main ballroom, which will
      provide excellent access to physicians and other attendees as they eat
      breakfast and come and go from the plenary and breakout sessions.
