            <p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
            <p>
               I hope you plan to join me and your peers at the 2021 WSMA
               Leadership Development Conference—one of WSMA’s most popular
               events. This year’s conference is more accessible than ever in a
               new virtual format, with world class programming and speakers.
               Don’t miss this opportunity to invest in yourself, build skills
               in quality improvement and leadership, and be energized through
               our virtual networking sessions.
            </p>
            <p>
               No matter your organizational role or where you are in your
               career journey, this leadership conference is for you. We are all
               leaders, regardless of title, hierarchy, or work situation. Our
               very roles mandate that we contribute expertise, experience,
               knowledge, vision—and hopefully, wisdom—to our patients, teams,
               and communities.
            </p>
            <p>
               As clinicians, we have an essential leadership role to play in
               redesigning complex healthcare delivery. Over the last two
               decades, our communities and the medical profession have
               recognized that the US healthcare system often falls short in
               meeting patients' and our own expectations for safety, quality,
               and efficiency. Quality improvement is hard and complex, but
               essential. The financial viability and success of hospitals and
               physician practices will depend on their ability to improve
               quality, safety, and value to patients and payers.
            </p>
            <p>
               Physicians must lead the transformation of care delivery systems
               to fulfill the expectations of our patients. Responsibility for
               care improvements cannot be delegated to administrators and
               insurers. Unfortunately, many physicians did not receive training
               in medical school on how to lead quality improvement projects.
               However, with the right training, physicians can acquire these
               skills at any career stage and can guide healthcare organizations
               with the optimal approach to safe and effective care delivery.
            </p>
            <p>
               The physician perspective is powerful and grounded in what is
               best for patients. It’s more important than ever that our voice
               is heard clearly and that we are influencing the future of health
               care and health care decisions.
            </p>
            <p>I look forward to seeing you in Chelan!</p>
