          I hope you plan to join me and your peers at the 2021 WSMA Leadership
          Development Conference. No matter your organizational role or where
          you are in your career journey, this leadership conference is for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          As clinicians, we have an essential leadership role to play in
          redesigning health care delivery. Quality improvement is hard and
          complex, but essential. The financial viability and success of
          hospitals and physician practices will depend on their ability to
          improve quality, safety, and value to patients and payers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Physicians must lead the transformation of care delivery systems to
          fulfill the expectations of our patients. Responsibility for care
          improvements cannot be delegated to administrators and insurers. With
          the right training, physicians can acquire the skills to lead quality
          improvement projects at any career stage and can guide health care
          organizations with the optimal approach to safe and effective care
          delivery.
        </p>
        <p>
          This year’s Leadership Development Conference will help you build your
          leadership skills by exploring new trends in care delivery and quality
          improvement while giving you opportunities to engage with other
          physician leaders. The conference features top-quality programming,
          including rapid-fire didactic sessions and highly interactive
          small-group discussions, and an esteemed faculty. And with its virtual
          format, you'll be able to access every session live and on demand
          conveniently in the comfort of your home.
        </p>
        <p>
          Don’t miss this opportunity to invest in yourself, build skills in
          quality improvement and leadership, and be energized through virtual
          networking sessions. The physician perspective is powerful and
          grounded in what is best for patients. It’s more important than ever
          that our voice is heard clearly and that we are influencing the future
          of health care and health care decisions.
        </p>
