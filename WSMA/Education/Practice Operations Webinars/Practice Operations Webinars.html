      <h2>ADEPT Advantage(SM): Creating a Value Management Model</h2>
      <p>
         Value is about so much more than just the financial outcome or the clinical outcome, it's about the whole organization - being as adept at
         the business of care as you are being a physician. Regardless of your organizational structure, five value systems - Application,
         Distinction, Effectiveness/Efficiencies, Profitability, Talent - exist in all of them. This webinar explores what it means to have an ADEPT
         advantage in your organization.

      <h2>Creating Bandwidth: Did You Ever Think to Stop?</h2>
      <p>
         Did you ever think to stop? We live in a very complex industry, and frequently, we make it complicated. The concept behind "Did you ever
         think to stop?" is to look at the work you are doing on a regular basis and whether or not there are things you are doing that are making
         your world more complicated.

      <h2>Finding Operational Wastes Through DOWNTIME</h2>
      <p>
         The activities we do every day have a very specific cost associated with them. There are many things you can do to look at your practice's
         operations and the acronym DOWNTIME: Defects, Overproduction, Waiting, Non-Utilized Talent, Transportation, Inventory, Motion, Extra
         Processing. We want to challenge you, in your practice, to give you a little bit more margin on the cost side and some savings, hopefully, to
         help you improve your financial bottom line.

      <h2>Managing by the Metrics: Using Your Data Advantage to Tackle Transformation</h2>
      <p>
         Data is everywhere. We want to help bring these disparate pieces together for you and help you make some sense about focusing on the right
         places at the right time. It's all about how you use your data advantage when you're tackling transformation in the organization. The best
         way to be successful, is by using your data to tell the story and making evidence-based decisions.
