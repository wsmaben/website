The activities we do every day have a very specific cost associated with them. There are many things you can do to look at your practice's operations and the acronym DOWNTIME: Defects, Overproduction, Waiting, Non-Utilized Talent, Transportation, Inventory, Motion, Extra Processing. With this webinar, part of the WSMA and V2V Management Solutions webinar series, we hope to challenge you, in your practice, to give you a little bit more margin on the cost side and some savings, hopefully, to help you improve your financial bottom line.
