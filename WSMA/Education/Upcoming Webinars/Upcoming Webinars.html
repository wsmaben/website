    <h1>Upcoming Webinars</h1>
    <p>
      Continuing professional development is the process of lifelong learning in
      which physicians acquire, through formal and informal activities, the
      medical and non-medical competencies they need to improve their ability to
      practice medicine and provide effective patient care. Engaging in
      continuing professional development is a professional obligation and also
      a prerequisite for enhancing the quality of health care. The WSMA
      introduced its Continuing Professional Development webinar series as part
      of our commitment to supporting physicians and physician assistants on
      their lifelong learning journey. Questions? Contact Jessica Martinson at

    <h2>
      The Sure NET Program – Outpatient Safety Risk: Diagnosis Detection and
      Follow up, Care Coordination, and Medication Safety
    </h2>
    <h3>Thursday, April 29, 2021 from noon–1 p.m.</h3>
    <p>
      The Washington Patient Safety Coalition, Washington State Hospital
      Association, and Washington State Medical Association are co-sponsoring a
      diagnostic excellence webinar series on the content, development and
      rollout of an educational program developed by Kaiser Permanente for
      providers:<em> Getting the Right Diagnosis at the Right Time. </em>The
      program promotes awareness on the factors that lead to diagnostic errors
      and how to achieve diagnostic excellence. Using research-based content,
      consultation with internal subject matter experts, leaders and patient
      advisors for content KP produced an educational video that yielded high
      acceptance and thoughtful reflections of clinical practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Northwest Safety and Quality Partnership along with the Medical
      Officer Collaborative have both underscored the priority of diagnostic
      excellence as a quality measure and one of the top 5 quality measures for
      focus. The effects of diagnostic errors are currently estimated to affect
      upwards of 12 million Americans each year, causing more harm to patients
      than all other hospital errors combined. These errors also have a marked
      impact on health care providers; the emotional effects of diagnostic error
      can be long-lasting and harmful. Patients identify the ramifications of
      diagnostic errors as emotional distress, prolonged illness and medical
      complications, impairment in activities of daily living, and decreased
      confidence in the health care system. Given the prevalence and impacts of
      diagnostic errors, health care leaders must address them as part of their
      quality improvement and patient safety programs.
