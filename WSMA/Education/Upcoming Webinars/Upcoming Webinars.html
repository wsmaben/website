      <p>
         Continuing professional development is the process of lifelong learning in which physicians acquire, through formal and informal activities,
         the medical and non-medical competencies they need to improve their ability to practice medicine and provide effective patient care. Engaging
         in continuing professional development is a professional obligation and also a prerequisite for enhancing the quality of health care. The
         WSMA introduced its Continuing Professional Development webinar series as part of our commitment to supporting physicians and physician
         assistants on their lifelong learning journey. Questions? Contact Jessica Martinson at
         <a href="mailto:jessica@wsma.org">jessica@wsma.org</a> or 206.956.3628.
