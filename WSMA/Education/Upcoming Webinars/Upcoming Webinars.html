      <p>
         Continuing professional development is the process of lifelong learning
         in which physicians acquire, through formal and informal activities,
         the medical and non-medical competencies they need to improve their
         ability to practice medicine and provide effective patient care.
         Engaging in continuing professional development is a professional
         obligation and also a prerequisite for enhancing the quality of health
         care. The WSMA introduced its Continuing Professional Development
         webinar series as part of our commitment to supporting physicians and
         physician assistants on their lifelong learning journey. Questions?
