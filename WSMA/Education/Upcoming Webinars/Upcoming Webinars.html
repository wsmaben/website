    <p>
      Continuing professional development is the process of lifelong learning in
      which physicians acquire, through formal and informal activities, the
      medical and non-medical competencies they need to improve their ability to
      practice medicine and provide effective patient care. Engaging in
      continuing professional development is a professional obligation and also
      a prerequisite for enhancing the quality of health care. The WSMA
      introduced its Continuing Professional Development webinar series as part
      of our commitment to supporting physicians and physician assistants on
      their lifelong learning journey.
