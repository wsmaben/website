		<h1 class="mobileShow">Upcoming Webinars</h1>
		<p>Continuing professional development is the process of lifelong learning in which physicians acquire, through formal and informal activities, the medical and non-medical competencies they need to improve their ability to practice medicine and provide effective patient care. Engaging in continuing professional development is a professional obligation and also a prerequisite for enhancing the quality of health care. The WSMA introduced its Continuing Professional Development webinar series as part of our commitment to supporting physicians and physician assistants on their lifelong learning journey.</p>

Guest speakers will share their expertise as well. The format will include 45 minutes of content and 30 minutes for a Q&amp;A discussion with the speakers.

		<p>Bill Robertson, president and CEO of MultiCare, will discuss the statewide collaboration to address Staying Open, Staying Safe issues identified in Governor Inslee’s Healthcare Reopening Proclamation 20-24.1. The goal is for the Washington healthcare system to remain 1) fully open and operating at all levels for all types of care, and 2) safe for both care givers and consumers of care. Mr. Robertson will outline the work products of the PPE strategic sourcing and distribution workgroup and the COVID-19 testing, tracking, tracing, and data management workgroup.</p>
