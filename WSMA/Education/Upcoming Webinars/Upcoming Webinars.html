    <p>
      Continuing professional development is the process of lifelong learning in
      which physicians acquire, through formal and informal activities, the
      medical and non-medical competencies they need to improve their ability to
      practice medicine and provide effective patient care. Engaging in
      continuing professional development is a professional obligation and also
      a prerequisite for enhancing the quality of health care. The WSMA
      introduced its Continuing Professional Development webinar series as part
      of our commitment to supporting physicians and physician assistants on
      their lifelong learning journey. Questions? Contact Jessica Martinson at

    <h2>
      New Physician Assistant Practice Laws and Regulations: Putting HB2378 into
      Practice
    </h2>
    <h3>Tuesday, June 8 from noon–1 p.m.</h3>
    <p>
      A key priority for the WSMA and the Washington Academy of Physician
      Assistants, House Bill 2378 from 2020 made important changes to the
      state’s physician assistant practice act, modernizing the profession and
      facilitating employment of these valued clinical partners. Major
      provisions of this important legislation take effect July 1. Speakers will
      outline how to implement the changes in your practice and discuss how to
      create practice agreements, which are taking the place of the current
      delegation agreements.
    </p>

    <h2>Fundamentals of Diagnostic Error in Imaging</h2>
    <h3>Tuesday, June 22 from noon–1 p.m.</h3>
    <p>
      Jason N. Itri, MD, PhD, President of Itri Consulting Group, LLC and
      Director of Quality and Associate Medical Director at Nines Radiology PA,
      will identify the components of a comprehensive process to learn from
      diagnostic error in radiology. He will describe the different approaches
      to identifying cases with diagnostic error and discuss educational and
      systematic interventions that can reduce diagnostic errors.
    </p>
    <p>
      This webinar is part of a series co-sponsored by the Washington State
      Hospital Association and Washington State Medical Association on
      diagnostic excellence. The Northwest Safety and Quality Partnership along
      with the Medical Officer Collaborative have both underscored the priority
      of diagnostic excellence as a quality and patient safety measure. The
      effects of diagnostic errors are currently estimated to affect upwards of
      12 million Americans each year, causing more harm to patients than all
      other hospital errors combined. These errors also have a marked impact on
      health care providers; the emotional effects of diagnostic error can be
      long-lasting and harmful. Patients identify the ramifications of
      diagnostic errors as emotional distress, prolonged illness and medical
      complications, impairment in activities of daily living, and decreased
      confidence in the health care system. Given the prevalence and impacts of
      diagnostic errors, health care leaders must address them as part of their
      quality improvement and patient safety programs.
