      Continuing professional development is the process of lifelong learning in
      which physicians acquire, through formal and informal activities, the
      medical and non-medical competencies they need to improve their ability to
      practice medicine and provide effective patient care. Engaging in
      continuing professional development is a professional obligation and also
      a prerequisite for enhancing the quality of health care. The WSMA
      introduced its Continuing Professional Development webinar series as part
      of our commitment to supporting physicians and physician assistants on
      their lifelong learning journey. Questions? Contact Jessica Martinson at

    <h2>
      Diagnostic Excellence Webinar Series – Lessons to Kaiser Permanente's
      Health Innovation Team
    </h2>
    <h3>Tuesday, March 23 from 11 a.m.–12 p.m.</h3>
    <p>
      Diagnosis is among the most critical and complex challenges clinicians
      face every day, and diagnostic errors are a significant patient safety
      concern. Misdiagnoses take a toll on all involved - patients and their
      families, and also on health care practitioners and their colleagues.
      Making the case and raising awareness is often challenging.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Washington Patient Safety Coalition, Washington State Hospital
      Association, and Washington State Medical Association are co-sponsoring a
      diagnostic excellence webinar series on the content, development and
      rollout of an educational program developed by Kaiser Permanente for
      providers:
      <em>Getting the Right Diagnosis at the Right Time.</em>&nbsp;The program
      promotes awareness on the factors that lead to diagnostic errors and how
      to achieve diagnostic excellence. Using research-based content,
      consultation with internal subject matter experts, leaders and patient
      advisors for content KP produced an educational video that yielded high
      acceptance and thoughtful reflections of clinical practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Ronald Loo and Mimi Hugh, will outline strategies to identify why and
      how diagnostic errors are made and how to avoid them, implement processes
      and practices to reduce diagnostic errors, and access resources to enhance
      the diagnostic process.
    </p>
    <p>Guest speakers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Ronald K Loo, MD is a practicing urologist, currently with an
        appointment at the Kaiser Permanente Downey Medical Center. Dr. Loo has
        regional oversight of the Kaiser Permanente Diagnostic Excellence
        Program, focused on a multi-disciplinary approach to reducing diagnostic
        errors. Professional activities in Innovation include oversight of next
        generation healthcare delivery models.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mimi Hugh, MA, MPH is the Director of SCPMG Performance Assessment. Ms.
        Hugh has been leading SCPMG’s initiatives to achieve diagnostic
        excellence, by identifying applicable measurement, developing
        educational materials for clinicians, and identifying methods for
        engaging patients.
