               <li>
                  An application is considered finalized when it has been <strong>submitted to the CME program committee</strong> for approval. A
                  final application must be submitted to the committee at least 30 days before the CME activity. Please
                  <a href="mailto:brendan@wsma.org">contact the CME department</a> if you have any concerns or questions about this policy.

      <h3>CME fees</h3>
      <p>Please <a href="mailto:brendan@wsma.org">ask the CME department</a> for details about your application.</p>
      <strong>Rush fee</strong>: $250 applied to application fee for a rush review. Both the CME staff review and submission will be slotted at the
      beginning of the queue. There is no guaranteed timing for review, submission, or approval.

      <p>Pre-Activity Documentation late fee</p>

      <a id="Pre-approval"></a>
      <h3>Pre-activity approval marketing</h3>
      <p>
         Marketing your activity prior to CME approval is allowed; however, CME credit should <strong>not</strong> be mentioned. Marketing material
         may <strong>not</strong> state<span style="color: windowtext"
            >, "Category 1 CME credit is pending" or the "Category 1 CME credit has been requested" or has been "applied for." Marketing materials may
            <strong>not</strong> include statements such as "8-hour educational meeting," which may mislead the learner to think CME has been
            awarded.</span
         >
      </p>
      All marketing materials must be approved by CME staff prior to distribution (including webpages, tweets, Facebook posts, etc.).

      <h3>General Information</h3>

      <p>Important</p>

      <p>
         If you are interested in applying for Maintenance of Certification credit for your activity, contact the
         <a href="mailto:brendan@wsma.org">CME department</a> prior to any planning. Certain requirements do change and will need to be implemented
         throughout the planning process. Failure to do so will disqualify you from awarding MOC credit.
      </p>

      <p>The following must be completed prior to the start of the planning process:</p>

      <ol>
         <li>
            At least one planning committee member must watch the ACCME's
            <a href="http://www.accme.org/education-and-support/video/tutorial/make-education-effective-and-relevant" target="_blank"
               >short 3 minute video</a
            >
            with Dion Richetti, ACCME Vice President for Accreditation and Recognition. The video explores our expectation for alignment between
            educational activities and the professional competencies as defined by CME stakeholders and healthcare leaders.
         </li>

         <li>
            Disclosure forms for the planners and, if applicable, resolution. This requirement is covered in detail in the
            <a href="https://wsma.org/cme-process-guide" target="_blank">Commercial Independence</a> section below.
         </li>

         <li>
            The activity chair and coordinator must complete the free <a href="http://www.nfeinitiative.org/" target="_blank">NFEI training</a> on
            appropriate CME content versus promotional activities. The online activity clarifies the roles and responsibilities of those in control of
            content and helps learners to understand current CME guidelines. The NFEI initiative maintains high standards in CME as well as protects
            the credibility of our CME activities. The training is between 30 &ndash; 45 minutes. Participants can start and stop and complete it in
            parts.
         </li>
      </ol>

      <p>WSMA staff is responsible for ensuring disclosure and training are completed prior to activity planning.</p>

      <a id="ActivityDetails"></a>
      <h3>Activity Details</h3>

      <p>
         Activity Planners Please list all individuals contributing to planning the activity, including each person's credentials, if possible. The
         activity chair is the individual most in control of content; including gap and need identification, speaker selection, agenda structure, etc.
         The chair does not need to be a physician.
      </p>

      <p>
         Agenda CME credit can be awarded in 15-minute (0.25 increments). Round up or down to the nearest 15-minute increment. Breaks and meals where
         education is interrupted do not count toward the total activity credits. If rounding, ensure that the total credit does not exceed the length
         of actual time in the meeting (i.e. rounding by session equals 2.5 hours, however the meeting only lasts from 1 p.m. - 3:15 p.m. (2.25
         hours). Total credits requested would be 2.25).

      <h3>Identification and resolution of conflicts of interest</h3>
      <p>
         The identification and resolution process are imperative to ensure that accredited CME is free from commercial bias. Accredited CME is
         accountable to the public for presenting clinical content that supports safe, effective patient care and does not promote the goods or
         services of a commercial interest.
      </p>
      <p>
         The WSMA uses disclosure forms as the first step in safeguarding against commercial bias. Everyone in control of an activity's educational
         content must complete a disclosure form and list all financial relationships they have with a commercial interest.
      </p>
      <p>
         The next step is for the planner(s) review each disclosure form and determine whether a conflict of interest exists (i.e. if there is a
         relevant financial relationship). Given the importance of identifying conflicts of interest, please consult with the WSMA CME staff if you
         have any questions about what constitutes a conflict of interest. If a conflict of interest is identified, the conflict is resolved according
         to policy.
      </p>
      <p>
         When the content of the activity is not related to the products or services of ACCME-defined commercial interests, those in control of
         content may submit a completed CME Attestation for Activities with No Potential for Conflict of Interest. WSMA CME staff must approve the use
         of this form prior to submission.
      </p>
      <p>
         <strong>Everyone in control of content must submit a signed disclosure and/or attestation form.</strong> Email replies will be accepted so
         long as the inquiry email includes all content verbatim from the Disclosure of Financial Relationships form (e.g. attach the disclosure
         and/or attestation form(s) to the email or copy/paste the text into the email).
      </p>
      <p>
         <strong>Timeline</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
         <strong>For planners:</strong> All conflicts of interest must be identified and resolved in advance of any activity planning. Attach the
         completed forms for each planner to the application and document your resolution mechanism for any conflicts of interest that are identified.

         <strong>For speakers:</strong> Provide completed forms for each person with the pre-activity documentation. All conflicts of interest must be
         identified and resolved in time to submit with the Pre-activity Documentation.
      </p>
      <a id="Definition"></a>
      <h3>Definitions:</h3>
      <p>
         <strong>Commercial interest:</strong> any entity producing, marketing, re-selling, or distributing health care goods or services consumed by,
         or used on patients.
      </p>
      <p>
         The ACCME does not consider providers of clinical service directly to patients to be commercial interests - unless the provider of clinical
         service is owned, or controlled by, an ACCME-defined commercial interest.
      </p>
      <p>
         With respect to personal financial relationships, <strong>contracted research</strong> includes research funding where the institution gets
         the grant and manages the funds. When the person is the <em>principal</em> or <em>named investigator</em> on the grant, this relationship
         must be disclosed to the WSMA.

            ><strong>Conflict of interest</strong></a
         >: circumstances create a conflict of interest when an individual has a financial relationship with a commercial interest that has products
         or services related to the content of the CME activity. The ACCME and WSMA consider financial relationships of the person involved in the CME
         activity to include financial relationships of a spouse or partner.

         <strong>Individual(s) in control of content:</strong> anyone who has the opportunity to affect the content (e.g., topics or speakers) of a
         CME activity at any point in the planning or implementation process are considered to be in control of content. Examples of individuals in
         control of content include but are not limited to: the activity planning committee, content reviewers, panel moderators, CME coordinators,
         speakers/presenters, the WSMA CME program committee, or WSMA CME staff.

      <h3>Tips for reporting disclosures on the CME Application and Pre-Activity Documentation:</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>If no financial disclosures were made, mark "no."</li>
         <li>
            If a financial relationship was disclosed, but upon review, this relationship is not relevant, mark "Relationship disclosed, reviewed, and
            is not a relevant financial relationship (include documentation)."
            <ul>
               <li>
                  Check this box if someone discloses a financial relationship with a:
                  <ul>
                     <li>
                        commercial interest that has products or services that are <em>unrelated </em>to the content of the CME activity (i.e. it
                        isn't <em>relevant</em>); and/or
                     </li>
                     <li>non-commercial interest as defined by the ACCME (e.g. published book).</li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <strong>NOTE: </strong>These disclosures must be reviewed by a person with nothing to disclose to confirm that there is no relevant
                  financial relationship. Include documentation of this review.
               </li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>
            If any relevant financial disclosures were made, mark "yes." Provide documentation of the mechanisms used to resolve all conflicts of
            interest.
         </li>
         <li>
            If the activity content is in no way related to an ACCME-defined commercial interest there cannot be any relevant financial relationships
            nor any potential conflicts of interest and you do not need to collect disclosure forms. If this is the case, mark the 4th checkbox which
            reads, "The content of this activity is in no way related to products or services of an ACCME-defined commercial interest; therefore,
            there are no relevant financial relationship to disclose and no potential conflicts of interest." Always check with the CME department
            staff before checking this box.
         </li>
      </ul>
      <a id="Resolution"></a>
      <h3>Resolving of Conflicts of Interest:</h3>
      <p>
         The activity chair is the primary person responsible for ensuring conflicts of interest are resolved. If the chair has a conflict of
         interest, then another content expert who does not have a conflict of interest should review everyone's disclosure(s) and take steps to
         resolve any conflict(s) of interest.
      </p>
      <p>The following are appropriate steps to take to resolve conflicts of interest.</p>
      <p>For Conflicts of Interest involving<strong> CME Activity Planning Committee Members and Peer Reviewers:</strong></p>
      <ol>
         <li>
            Planning decisions may be peer reviewed by someone with no disclosures of potential conflicts of interest related to the content of the
            activity. This review is intended to assure balance in presentations. If that balance appears to be a problem, the committee member is
            excused from further planning responsibilities.
         </li>
         <li>
            The activity can change in focus so it does not include information related to products or services about which the planning committee
            member has a conflict.
         </li>
         <li>The scope of the planner's involvement may be limited to exclude topics that relate to their conflict of interest.</li>
         <li>The committee member may document that the relationship with the commercial interest has been severed.</li>
         <li>
            The activity applicant can submit their proposed resolution with an alternate method to the WSMA CME Program Committee to determine
            whether the change was sufficient to remove the potential conflict of interest.
         </li>
      </ol>
      <p>For Conflicts of Interest involving <strong>CME Activity Presenters (e.g. speakers, panelists, moderators):</strong></p>
      <p>
         A planning committee member with no conflicts of interest or someone at another level of oversight with no conflicts of interest (e.g.
         external peer reviewers or the WSMA CME Program Committee members) must:
      </p>
      <ol>
         <li>
            Review the content to be presented by the speaker in advance to assure content balance. If there is a concern about balance, conversation
            between the reviewer and speaker must occur to change the presentation to avoid the potential conflict. If the reviewer and speaker cannot
            agree on changes, the speaker will be disqualified. If changes are agreed upon, then the new content must be reviewed to assure that no
            potential conflict of interest persists. If the reviewer is not satisfied, the speaker is disqualified, and a different presenter is
            selected who has no relevant financial relationships.
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
               <li>
                  After review, the recommendation from the planning committee may be to change the topic for the presenter so that the presentation
                  is not related to products or services where a conflict exists.
               </li>
               <li>
                  After review, the recommendation from the planning committee may be to limit or specify the sources for the recommendations that the
                  presenter can use and assure that the limit is known to the audience.
               </li>
            </ol>
         </li>
         <li>The presenter may document that the relationship with the commercial interest has been severed.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
         The step(s) should be documented in a written attestation describing the process taken to resolve conflicts of interest.
         <em>For example: </em>
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            The chair reviews the PowerPoint presentation and determines that the content is evidence-based and unbiased. Nothing further needs to be
            done to "resolve" the conflict of interest. The chair's review and findings are documented and attested to in a letter to the CME Program
            Committee.
         </li>
         <li>
            The chair reviews the PowerPoint presentation and finds finds a slide with commercial interest names and logos. The chair reviews the
            Clinical Content Validation Policy (below) with the speaker and asks the speaker to remove the promotional content. The speaker removes
            the conflict from the slide. The chair's review, findings, and process for resolving the issue are documented and attested to in a letter
            to the CME Program Committee.
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
         In addition to identifying relationships with commercial interests, the disclosure and attestation forms are also the WSMA's method to relay
         the expectations for planners and faculty. Specifically, the form includes the Content Validation Policy, which states:
      </p>
      <a id="ContentValidation"></a>
      <h3>WSMA CME Clinical Content Validation Policy</h3>
      <p>
         WSMA is responsible for validating the clinical content of CME activities it provides, both jointly and directly. Accredited CME activities
         are accountable to the WSMA, participants and the public for presenting clinical content that supports safe and effective patient care. This
         policy intends to ensure that patient care recommendations made during CME activities are accurate, reliable and based on current scientific
         evidence. Clinical care recommendations must be supported by data, scientific evidence or information that is accepted within the profession
         of medicine. Specifically,
      </p>
      <ol>
         <li>
            All the recommendations for care, medications or diagnostic procedures involving clinical medicine in a CME activity must be based on the
            best evidence available that meets accepted standards within the profession of medicine. Presenters are expected to provide adequate
            justification for their indications and contraindication in the care of patients.
         </li>
         <li>
            All scientific research referred to, reported, or used in CME in support or justification of a patient care recommendation must conform to
            the generally accepted standards of experimental design, data collection and analysis. Any variation from or incompleteness of the
            research is to be identified, relayed and explained to the audience to allow assessment of its validity and usefulness.
         </li>
         <li>
            No activity may award credit for CME if it intends to promote recommendations, treatments, or manners of practicing medicine that are not
            within the generally accepted standards of medical care, known to have risks or dangers that outweigh the benefits or are known to be
            ineffective in the treatment of patients. Activities that are devoted to advocacy of unscientific modalities of diagnosis or therapy are
            not eligible for CME credit.
         </li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Methods to ensure independent activities </strong></p>
      <ol>
         <li>
            Use of generic names. If the CME educational material or content includes trade names, where available trade names from several companies
            should be used, not just trade names of single products.
         </li>
         <li>
            Unless this is a product which has no comparable alternatives, the educational content should list all like products, including pros and
            cons.
         </li>
         <li>Reference sources, ideally peer-reviewed journals, for any clinical recommendations.</li>
      </ol>
      <a id="Documenting"></a>
      <h3>Documenting the Resolution Process</h3>
      <p>
         List the names of planning committee members under the relevant checkbox for the Resolution of Conflict of Interest. When submitting the
         pre-activity documentation, list the names of faculty, moderators, and/or reviewers under the checkbox for the Resolution of Conflict of
         Interest.
      </p>
      <p>
         Check the box(es) on the application and include documentation (see below for examples) of the resolution process applied. The options are:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>Resolution disclosed, reviewed, and found to be related to the activity.</li>
         <li>Relationship disclosed, reviewed and found to be not related to activity.</li>
         <li>Relationship disclosed, reviewed and is not a commercial interest.</li>
         <li>
            The content of this activity is in no way related to products or services of an ACCME-defined commercial interest; therefore, there are no
            relevant financial relationship to disclose and no potential conflicts of interest -
            <em>Always check with WSMA staff before checking this box.</em>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <a id="AudienceDisclosure"></a>
      <h3>Disclosure to audience</h3>
      <p>
         In order to ensure to our audience that the activity was planned independently and that the education they are about to receive will be
         disseminated free of commercial bias, we have to disclose to them what we discovered in our disclosure process. Once you have received the
         disclosure and/or attestation forms, reviewed for possible conflicts, and resolved all conflicts of interest, we then create the disclosure
         to audience.
      </p>
      <p>
         Disclosure of relevant relationships to commercial interests for everyone in control of content must be made to the audience prior to the
         beginning of the activity.
      </p>
      <p>Disclosure can be made in any of the following ways:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Presented in the syllabus</li>
         <li>Made verbally (include a written attestation of completion for the file)</li>
         <li>Visually on activity slides</li>
         <li>On the activity website</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Use the wording as follows:</p>
      <p><strong>Nothing to Disclose </strong></p>
      <p>If <em>no one</em> in control of content (including both planners and speakers) has anything to disclose, you may state the following:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px">
         No one in control of content has indicated a relevant financial relationship with an ACCME-defined commercial interest. All clinical content
         presented is evidence-based and unbiased.

            ACCME-defined commercial interest: <em><strong>Planner name, name of commercial interest, type of relationship</strong></em> Their
            planning contributions were evidence-based and unbiased. All others in control of content have indicated no relevant financial
            relationship with an ACCME-defined commercial interest. All clinical content presented is evidence-based and unbiased.

         <li>
            <strong>Faculty (please list)</strong>: The following faculty have indicated (a) relevant financial relationship(s) with an ACCME-defined
            commercial interest: <em><strong>Faculty name, name of commercial interest, type of relationship</strong></em> Their
            contributions/presentations will be evidence-based and unbiased. All others in control of content have indicated no relevant financial
            relationship with an ACCME-defined commercial interest. All clinical content presented is evidence-based and unbiased.
         </li>

      <p><strong>Activity Not Related to Commercial Interests</strong></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px">
         The content of this activity is not related to products or services of an ACCME-defined commercial interest; therefore no one in control of

         In this section we will identify the reason for holding this educational activity, clarify our objectives, and determine what we want the end
         result to be for our learners. In addition, this section will give us the opportunity to think outside the box with regard to planning an
         activity - we can identify the best methods to transmit information and determine if there are any ways to engage in additional methods to
         create the most comprehensive educational activity for our learners.

      <h3>Identifying Professional Practice Gaps</h3>
      <p>
         <strong>What is the problem that needs to be addressed? Identify gaps in physician learning.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
         A "gap" is the difference between what is currently going on in practice compared to ideal or best practice. A gap in practice may be
         identified due to new guidelines, treatment, management, and prevention mechanisms. Additionally, a gap in practice may be identified due to
         failure to meet new guidelines, treatment, management, and prevention mechanisms.
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>For example</em>: The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends screening all children for diabetes at 5 years of age. It has been
         identified that primary care physicians in Washington state are not screening all children for diabetes at the 5-year mark. Therefore,
         children are not receiving the care they need in a timely manner.
      </p>

      <p>
         Please note: a new guideline in itself does not describe a gap. A gap would exist between the information contained in new clinical practice
         guideline, treatment, management, or prevention mechanism and the knowledge and information necessary to implement it.
      </p>

      <p>Does the reason for this activity relate to any of the following? The following expressions may help you describe your educational gap.</p>

      <ul>
         <li>New or updated approaches in technology/treatment/services</li>
         <li>New regulatory, organizational, legal requirements/changes</li>
         <li>Updates in education or training</li>
         <li>Not applying current clinical algorithms</li>
         <li>Inappropriate clinical management</li>
         <li>Rapid advances in the field</li>
         <li>New or updated processes of care</li>
         <li>Appropriate referrals to specialist</li>
         <li>Condition is poorly understood</li>
         <li>Coordinating care</li>
         <li>New or changes in scope of practice/guidelines for care/evidence based medicine</li>
         <li>Experience in managing or treating</li>
         <li>Condition is difficult or challenging to diagnosis or treat Applying wrong or incorrect technique</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Gaps can be between populations of patients:</p>

      <ul>
         <li>Health outcomes for African American women with breast cancer compared to health outcomes for Caucasian women</li>
         <li>The differences in health outcomes between patients in various parts of the country</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Gaps can be in the outcomes of patient care:</p>

      <ul>
         <li>Only 75% of patients receive care according to certain clinical guidelines</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Gaps can be in physician performance:</p>

      <ul>
         <li>Only 60% of physicians in our clinic prescribe a particular drug appropriately</li>
         <li>Dr. Smith prescribes the drug appropriately 80% of the time</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
         There are many ways that quality gaps and/or physician gaps can be identified. One way to think about the myriad of sources that could point
         to gaps is to think about the sources being at different levels:
      </p>
      <ol>
         <li>Individual physician level &ndash; for CME activities such as point-of-care or performance in practice</li>
         <li>Group level (e.g., physician group)</li>
         <li>Health care provider level</li>
         <li>Local community level</li>
         <li>State and regional level</li>
         <li>National level</li>
      </ol>

      <strong>Ways to identify gaps</strong>
      <p>
         At each of these levels there are several areas that could be reviewed to identify gaps. WSMA's Provider Education menu on the public
         <a href="http://wsma.org/cme">CME page</a> has links to many sources for gaps.
      </p>

      <ol>
         <li>
            Individual physician level: Performance gaps could be identified by asking physicians about their performance (how often do you do X)
            and/or by auditing patient charts. One downside of asking physicians to subjectively assess and report their performance is that they may
            not be able to give an accurate self-assessment. This type of gap assessment is best used for individualized CME, such as performance
            improvement CME and point-of-care.
         </li>

         <li>
            Group level: Chart audits could also help identify gaps at a group level. More and more physician groups now report their performance and
            patient outcomes to outside sources. These sources can be tapped to look at performance and quality gaps.
         </li>

         <li>
            Health care provider level: Physician group, hospital, and healthcare system quality and performance data are available publicly from a
            variety of sources. A few of the sources are provided here:
            <ul>
               <li><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/hospitalcompare/search.html">Hospital Compare</a></li>
               <li><a href="http://www.leapfroggroup.org/">Leapfrog Group</a></li>
               <li><a href="http://www.wahospitalquality.org/">Washington Hospital Quality</a></li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>
            Local community level: Public health departments have data about the communities they serve. These data can point to quality gaps. Local
            newspapers often report on health conditions, quality of care, and problems in health delivery services in areas affecting their readers.
            These data often directly relate to local, community level quality care gaps. In addition, sources such as the following can be accessed
            to review quality data at a local, community level:
            <ul>
               <li><a href="http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/">County Health Rankings</a></li>
               <li><a href="http://www.wacommunitycheckup.org/">Washington Health Alliance Community Checkup</a></li>
            </ul>
         </li>

         <li>
            State and regional level: Government agencies, in addition to other groups, publish data at the state and regional levels:
            <ul>
               <li><a href="http://www.doh.wa.gov/">Washington State Department of Health</a></li>
               <li><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/">Centers for Disease Control Prevention</a></li>
               <li><a href="http://kff.org/statedata/">State Health Facts</a></li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>
            National level: National health data are available from a variety of sources, including:
            <ul>
               <li><a href="http://www.ahrq.gov/">Agency for Healthcare Research Quality</a></li>
               <li><a href="http://www.healthdata.org/us-health">Institute for Health Metrics Evaluation</a></li>
            </ul>
         </li>
      </ol>

      <p>Each activity will have its own sources for identifying performance and/or quality gaps.</p>

      <a id="Needs"></a>
      <h3>Identifying Educational Needs</h3>
      <h4>What type of educational needs do the learners have?</h4>
      <p>
         Learning needs can contribute to the gap (i.e. due to the needs there is a gap in practice). Identifying the educational need helps identify
         how we can close the gap. In other words, to solve the problem (gap), the learner "needs" to... In order to identify what the learner needs
         to learn in the educational session, it is helpful to explore if the learner:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>Has a <strong>knowledge</strong> deficit <em> For example:</em> The learner doesn't know or understand the new guidelines.</li>
         <li>
            Has a <strong>competence</strong> [strategy] deficit <em>For example:</em> The learner knows the guidelines but lacks the ability or
            strategy necessary to apply them in practice.
         </li>
         <li>
            Has a <strong>performance</strong> deficit <em>For example:</em> The learner knows the guidelines and has a strategy in place to perform
            them but has not put their abilities into practice.
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
         For example: If a gap were detected in prescribing a new drug for a certain indication, asking why the gap exists could help identify if
         learners need:
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px">
         - <strong>knowledge</strong> on the use of the drug (knowledge need), - <strong>strategies</strong> for identifying when to prescribe the
         drug (competence need), or - <strong>support</strong> to ensure they are indeed prescribing the drug appropriately (performance need).
      </p>
      <a id="Sources"></a>
      <h3 id="IdentifyingSources">Identifying Sources:</h3>
      <h4>How did you recognize this opportunity for change?</h4>
      <p>
         What sources did you use to identify the gap (above)? Remember, all activities may have different sources. Is the gap based on a quality gap
         at the hospital level? Is there a public health gap identified through the local public health department? Were there new clinical guidelines
         issued by your specialty society's national organization? Check the box(es) that apply.
      </p>
      <a id="Outcomes"></a>
      <h3 id="ExpectedOutcomes">Expected Outcomes</h3>
      <p>What are you trying to change? This section will help formulate what type of evaluation tool to use later in the application process.</p>
      <ul>
         <li><strong>Competence:</strong> The learner now has a strategy in place to improve patient outcomes</li>
         <li><strong>Performance:</strong> The learner is now able to perform strategy in their professional practice.</li>
         <li>
            <strong>Patient Outcomes:</strong> The learner had an opportunity to perform their strategy in practice and as a result, patient outcomes
            were affected.
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>State what the CME activity is designed to change in terms of competence, performance, and/or patient outcomes (max 50 words).</p>
      <a id="Objectives"></a>
      <h3 id="LearnerObjectives">Learner Objectives</h3>
      <p>
         What do you want the learner to do after this activity? While the need indicated a behavior that wasn't being done in practice, the objective
         states what we want them to be able to accomplish after the educational session. In order to evaluate our activity later to see if we
         accomplished our goals, the objectives must be stated in behavioral, measurable terms. For example, you can measure if they can "apply" a
         concept; however, measuring if they "understand" would be less straightforward.

      <p>Going beyond "understand"</p>
      <p>
         The ultimate goal of CME is to change <strong>behavior and outcomes.</strong> We expect that change in knowledge is implicit in our
         educational opportunities. Through implementation of the knowledge, we will change a competence, performance, and patient outcomes.
      </p>

      <p>
         To facilitate the transfer of learning into practice, learning objectives need to go beyond helping physicians "know" or "comprehend"
         something. Rather than "understand newly released clinical guidelines," we want our learners to "apply the guidelines," or at a minimum, be
         able to "describe the guidelines and how they should be applied."
      </p>

      <p>
         By thinking of the end result (what we want the learner to do in practice) we can write behavioral objectives that can be applied in
         practice. Start with the end in mind.
      </p>

      <p>
         The Bloom's Taxonomy chart below provides some helpful prompts for writing learner objectives. The rows of verbs become progressively
         action-oriented as you read them left to right. Please see the
         <a href="javascript://[Uploaded files/Services/CME Services/Become an Accredited Provider/AAFPLearningObjectivesGuidelines.pdf]"

      <a id="Target"></a>
      <h3>Target Audience</h3>
      <p>
         Who needs to receive this information? Identifying the appropriate target audience will help you identify the specific gap and create an
         agenda.
      </p>

      <p>
         If the activity is focused on neurology for primary care physicians, the agenda should not be at a neurologist level, it should be presented
         at a primary care level. If the target audience includes rural physicians that have a more general practice, the activity should focus on how
         to disseminate specialized updates to generalized practices.
      </p>

      <p>
         <em>For example:</em> Practicing clinicians involved in obstetric care and other healthcare providers and maternity leaders in Washington
         state.

      <a id="Format"></a>
      <h3>Educational Format</h3>
      <p>
         <em>"Liberating education consists in acts of cognition, not transferals of information." &ndash; Paolo Freire </em>
      </p>

      <p>
         Studies show that within <em>one hour</em> learners will have forgotten an average of 50 percent of the new information presented. Within
         <em>24 hours</em> they have forgotten an average of 70 percent and within <em>one week </em>they will have forgotten 90 percent of
         information. But you can do something about that learning curve!
      </p>

      <ul>
         <li>
            Use a variety of learning methods: Studies also show that learners are able to retain information better (more quickly and accurately) in
            activities that include a variety of modalities besides didactic and PowerPoint presentations. Explore with your planning committee
            alternate learning methods, such as hands-on training, role-playing, and games. Think about ways in which you as an adult learner learn.
         </li>
         <li>
            Repeat, repeat, repeat: Stop forgetfulness in its tracks. Reinforcing your message throughout the learning process will help decrease the
            percentage of forgotten information. Repeat your message early and often.
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
         To achieve the optimum educational environment for your learner, consider your gap, educational need and learning objectives. What are you
         trying to accomplish with your activity? Different educational formats can be used in different ways to help learners achieve the educational
         outcome.
      </p>

      <p>
         <em>For example: </em>An activity which is designed to give the physician the resources to identify situations in practice in which new
         guidelines are applicable, may benefit from education which re-creates these situations using role-playing, i.e. an actor "patient" describes
         symptoms to see if the physician is able to accurately diagnose and apply the guidelines.
      </p>

      <p>Learning experiences are broken into three tiers.</p>

      <ul>
         <li><strong>Tier 1</strong>: Education is interactive. The learner is actively engaged and has an opportunity to perform skills learned.</li>
         <li><strong>Tier 2</strong>: Education is interactive. The learner is actively engaged and participates in learning experience.</li>
         <li><strong>Tier 3</strong>: Education is lecture-based. The learner is passive.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Please select all relevant educational formats.</p>

      <p>Why is this educational format appropriate?</p>

      <p>How is the choice of educational format going to help your learner achieve the optimal learning outcome?</p>

      <p>
         <em>For example:</em> Learners are invited to participate in small group discussion after a brief didactic session to process concepts and
         describe how they will implement them in their own practices. Additionally, it will give learners an opportunity to hear how colleagues will
         implement new concepts.
      </p>

      <h3>Desirable Physician Attributes</h3>
      <p>
         Accredited CME looks to align itself with "competencies," or values, as identified by recognized medical organizations and boards to guide
         educational efforts. Aligning our education with these competencies is a further step in legitimizing the scope of CME.

            >Commercial Interest</a
         >
         such as a pharmaceutical or medical device manufacturer. All commercial support must have a signed
         <a href="#Forms">letter of agreement</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
         <strong>Exhibit fees</strong> are not considered commercial support, even if they are from a Commercial Interest. When representatives from a
         commercial interest will be present at a CME event, they must sign <a href="#Forms">an agreement</a> outlining expected behavior.
      </p>

      <p>
         If a supporter would like to purchase an exhibit space and would like to fund a portion of the meeting (either financially or in-kind), the
         funding portion is considered commercial support and <strong>must</strong> have a signed letter of agreement.
      </p>

      <p>
         You do not need to have all grants and agreements signed at the time of the application submission; they will be due with the pre-activity
         documentation prior to your activity.
      </p>

      <a id="Budget"></a>
      <h3>Budget</h3>
      <p>
         Please complete an estimate of the budget for this CME activity. Enter income and expense revenue estimates for each relevant line. More
         lines may be entered as needed.
      </p>

      <p>Please note that if there will be more than 1 speaker, the honoraria should be broken out by individual speaker.</p>

      <h4>Budget Definitions</h4>
      <p>
         <strong>Government grants</strong>: monetary grants received from federal, state or local governmental agencies in support of your activity.
      </p>

      <p>
         <strong>Advertising/vendors/exhibitors</strong>: money received for advertising or exhibiting; not commercial support. Please use the
         exhibitor agreement for each exhibitor or vendor.
      </p>

      <p>
         <strong>Unrestricted Educational Grants from Commercial Interests</strong>: Financial support from a Commercial Interest. Must have signed
         letter of agreement at time of activity. WSMA has a letter of agreement you may use, or you may use the commercial interest's letter of
         agreement, so long as it meets the WSMA's expectations for independence (WSMA staff can help you determine if this is the case).
      </p>

      <p><strong>Tuition/Registration</strong>: Income expected from learner tuition or registration fees.</p>

      <p>
         <strong>Other (private monetary donations)</strong>: money received from the private sector, including foundation or direct organizational
         support, in support of your activity. Organizational support would be actual money exchange (i.e. Medical Staff Services paying the CME
         department; it does not include "internal allocations" or generalized overhead for CME services).
      </p>

      <a id="Marketing"></a>
      <h3>Marketing</h3>
      <p>
         You are required to submit all marketing materials for approval prior to publication, distribution, broadcasting, or going live. Marketing
         may be submitted prior to submission of the activity application.
      </p>

      <p>
         Check the box to attest that all marketing materials will be submitted for review. This may be an ongoing review if you plan to market your
         activity in a variety of formats and at different times.
      </p>

      <p>
         WSMA staff will only need to approve a specific wording/method for an approved activity once; if you use that same marketing material again
         you do not need to resubmit for approval.

         <strong>Interprofessional Teams (<a href="http://www.accme.org/accreditation-rules/accreditation-criteria/criterion-23">C23</a>)</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
         ACCME Rationale: Interprofessional continuing education (IPCE) occurs when members from two or more professions learn with, from, and about
         each other to enable effective interprofessional collaborative practice and improve health outcomes. This criterion recognizes accredited
         providers that work collaboratively with multiple health professions to develop IPCE.
      </p>

      <p>Please note that this criterion requires that there be both planners and faculty from interprofessional disciplines.</p>

      <p>
         <strong
            >Strategies Beyond Clinical Care (<a href="http://www.accme.org/accreditation-rules/accreditation-criteria/criterion-27">C27</a>)
         </strong>
      </p>

      <p>
         ACCME Rationale: This criterion recognizes providers for expanding their CME programs beyond clinical care education to address factors
         affecting the health of populations. Some examples of these factors include health behaviors; economic, social, and environmental conditions;
         healthcare and payer systems; access to care; health disparities; or the population's physical environment.
      </p>

      <p>Please submit a brief description of strategies beyond clinical care which will be taught to learners.</p>

      <p>
         <strong>Collaboration (<a href="http://www.accme.org/accreditation-rules/accreditation-criteria/criterion-28">C28</a>) </strong>
      </p>

      <p>
         ACCME Rationale: Collaboration among people and organizations builds stronger, more empowered systems. This criterion recognizes providers
         that apply this principle by building collaborations with other organizations that enhance the effectiveness of the CME program in addressing
         community/population health issues.
      </p>

      <p>
         Collaborators must be from outside organizations. Furthermore, collaborators are purposefully chosen and not necessarily a joint provider or
         educational partner who has been contracted to assist in managing the activity.
      </p>

      <p>
         Please provide a list of collaborators (spelling out acronyms) and a brief description of how this will impact the WSMA's ability to address
         population health issues.
      </p>

      <p>
         <strong>Communication (<a href="http://www.accme.org/accreditation-rules/accreditation-criteria/criterion-29">C29</a>) </strong>
      </p>

      <p>
         ACCME Rationale: Communication skills are essential for professional practice. Communication skills include verbal, nonverbal, listening, and
         writing skills. Some examples are communications with patients, families, and teams; and presentation, leadership, teaching, and
         organizational skills. This criterion recognizes providers that help learners become more self-aware of their communication skills and offer
         CME to improve those skills. In the application, please provide a brief description of how communication skills will be observed and how
         feedback will be given to the learners.
      </p>

      <p>
         When submitting post-activity documentation, please submit evidence of the observation and evaluation of learners' communication skills. The
         summarized evaluations may fulfill this requirement. Please ask the CME department to be sure.
      </p>

      <p>
         <strong>Individual Learning Plans (<a href="http://www.accme.org/accreditation-rules/accreditation-criteria/criterion-31">C31</a>) </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
         ACCME Rationale: This criterion recognizes providers that develop individualized educational planning for the learner; customize an existing
         curriculum for the learner; track learners through a curriculum; or work with learners to create a self-directed learning plan where the
         learner assesses their own gaps and selects content to address those gaps. The personalized education needs to be designed to close the
         individual's professional practice gaps over time. In the application, please provide a brief description of the individualized learning plan
         and feedback to the learner.
      </p>

      <p>
         When submitting post-activity documentation, please submit evidence of feedback given to the learner regarding their individualized learning
         plan. The summarized evaluations may fulfill this requirement. Please ask the CME department to be sure.

            >Support Strategies Adjunct to CME (<a href="http://www.accme.org/accreditation-rules/accreditation-criteria/criterion-32">C32</a>)
         </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
         ACCME Rationale: This criterion recognizes providers that create, customize, or make available supplemental services (e.g., reminders) and/or
         resources (e.g., online instructional material, apps) that are designed to reinforce or sustain change.
      </p>

      <p>
         Support strategies used must be adjunct to the CME activity. Examples include but are not limited to: post activity email reminder of
         educational points; post activity discussion; or online resources or toolkits. Please note that to fulfill this criterion, there must be some
         kind of follow-up ("periodic analysis") to determine the effectiveness of the support strategy. "Periodic analysis" may include: analyzing
         the rate of opened emailed reminders and usage of links therein; tracking participation of post activity discussion; or monitoring data
         related to educational topics. Furthermore, planned improvements of future educational activities as a result of this analysis must be
         demonstrated.
      </p>

      <p>
         When submitting post-activity documentation, please include a copy of the support strategy along with a brief explanation of the "periodic
         analysis" and planned improvements to future activities. If analysis and planned improvements have not happened within the allotted time
         frame, please indicate when these will happen. The CME department will follow up for more information at that time.

      <p>
         The chair is responsible for reading and abiding by all WSMA and ACCME criteria and Standards for Commercial Support. Have the chair review
         and initial the attestation and sign when completed. The signature must be the actual, faxed or verified digital signature (using a trusted
         verified signature program). Plain text or inserted digital signature will not be accepted.
      </p>

      <p>
         If your activity plans to provide Maintenance of Certification (MOC) points, your chair is responsible for reading and abiding by all
         relevant Board and ACCME requirements. Have the chair review and initial the attestation and sign when completed. The signature must be the
         actual, faxed or verified digital signature. Plain text or inserted digital signature will not be accepted.

      <a id="MOC"></a>
      <h2>Maintenance of Certification (MOC)</h2>

      <p>
         In an effort to assist physicians who are required to obtain Maintenance of Certification (MOC) points, the ACCME has aligned with various
         specialty boards. This means that activities accredited for CME may also be certified for MOC points from one or more qualifying specialty
         board.
      </p>

      <p>
         While they are similar, each specialty board has its own requirements for an activity to be eligible for MOC points, and it is the Chair's
         responsibility to ensure that the CME activity will meets these standards.
      </p>

      <p>
         <strong><em>Please note:</em></strong>
         <em
            >the activity Chair must submit an addendum for <strong>each board</strong> from which they would like MOC points at the time of the CME
            application submission.
         </em>
      </p>

      <p>The boards currently aligned with the ACCME are:</p>

      <ul>
         <li>American Board of Anesthesiologists (ABA)</li>
         <li>American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM)</li>
         <li>American Board of Ophthalmology (ABO)</li>
         <li>American Board of Otolaryngology (Head and Neck) (ABOHNS)</li>
         <li>American Board of Pathology (ABPath)</li>
         <li>American Board of Pediatrics (ABP)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
         If your activity has been approved for Maintenance of Certification points, the relevant Board MOC statement must be used. CME staff will
         provide you with the current MOC statement for each board, as applicable.
      </p>

      <p>
         Please refer to the most current <a href="http://www.accme.org/cme-support-moc">Board Program Guides</a> on the ACCME website for more
         information.
      </p>

      <p>
         Finally, please add the following information to alert the learners that participation in MOC activities is not a condition of receiving
         <em>AMA PRA Category 1 Credit</em>&trade;:

      <p>
         The accreditation statement must appear on all CME activity materials and brochures distributed by accredited organizations, except that the
         accreditation statement does not need to be included on initial, save-the-date type activity announcements. Such announcements contain only
         general, preliminary information about the activity such as the date, location, and title. If more specific information is included, such as

         In the application section you may have indicated your activity will receive money from a Commercial Interest for accepting exhibitors or
         vendors at your CME activity. If you will receive money for exhibitors, vendors, or accept representatives from commercial interests, attach
         a signed
         <a href="javascript://[Uploaded files/Services/CME Services/Become an Accredited Provider/Commercial Promotion Agreement 20201008.pdf]"
            >Agreement</a
         >
         for every Commercial Interest that will be present.
      </p>

      <p>
         <em>Jointly provided activities must have 3 signatures:</em>
      </p>
      <ol>
         <li>Your organization's representative</li>
         <li>WSMA CME department representative</li>
         <li>Commercial Interest representative</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
         <em>Directly provided activities must have 2 signatures: </em>
      </p>
      <ol>
         <li>WSMA CME department representative</li>
         <li>Commercial Interest representative</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The signed Agreements are due with the pre-activity documentation.</p>
      <a id="Evaluation"></a>
      <h3>Evaluation</h3>
      <p>
         Evaluation is an attempt to measure "Did we do what we said we were going to do?" Take a moment to look back at your activity application.
         When asked to identify outcomes, what did you design your objectives to change? By designing your objectives to change behavior, you can now
         structure your evaluation to measure if you were successful in transferring both knowledge and the ability to apply that knowledge to your
         learner.
      </p>

      <p>
         <em>For example:</em>
      </p>
      <p>
         A course on communication may best be assessed with a role-playing situation, where the learner has an opportunity to use the skills learned.
      </p>

      <p>
         A course on new techniques may be best assessed using a case presentation, where the learner reads a medical case and answers how they would
         treat the patient using the new skills learned.
      </p>

      <p>
         Below are options for assessing your learner. They are broken out by intended outcomes (competence, performance, patient outcomes). Using the
         knowledge of your learners and what the activity intends to change, identify the evaluation method that will best measure that change.
      </p>

      <a id="Competence"></a>
      <h4>Assessing Competence (subjective)</h4>
      <p>
         If you plan to measure your learners immediately after the activity, you can measure for competence (strategies that will be implemented once
         the learner is back at their practice). Use the following list as options for your evaluation. You may also create your own. Make sure your
         method is approved by WSMA staff first.

         If you choose to use an online evaluation tool, such as Survey Monkey, to subjectively assess competence using a Likert scale, WSMA has a
         sample template you may use.
      </p>
      <a id="Performance"></a>
      <h4>Assessing Performance (subjective)</h4>
      <p>
         If you plan to measure performance, you may need to wait until the learner has had a chance to implement (perform) the skill in practice. You
         may choose the timeline, but typically learners are evaluated 3, 6, or 9 months post-activity to see if they implemented change.

      <h4>Assessing Patient Outcomes</h4>
      <p>
         Measuring patient outcomes is a long-term goal. Ideally you would look at your same needs assessment material (e.g. hospital quality data)
         after a specific amount of time and see if that same data has changed.
      </p>

      <p><em>For example: </em></p>

      <p>
         Assessing the county health records you see that your county has lower than average vaccination rates. Using this data you create an activity
         to help physicians appropriately administer vaccinations. After 1 year you return to the county health record data to see if the vaccination
         rates in your county have changed. You submit this data to WSMA as your evaluation.
      </p>

      <p>
         <em>NOTE:</em> There does not have to be change for you to report this data (e.g. the vaccination rates do not change). We want to see the
         data which was reported.
      </p>

      <a id="Questions"></a>
      <h4>Mandatory questions</h4>
      <p>Please include the following questions in your evaluation method:</p>
      <ol>
         <li>
            A "commercial interest" is defined as any entity producing, marketing, re-selling or distributing health care goods or services consumed
            by, or used on, patients. Among the exemptions to this definition are government organizations, non-health care related companies and
            non-profit organizations that do not advocate for commercial interests. Did you perceive any bias toward a "commercial interest" in this
            activity?

            <ul>
               <li>No Yes If yes, please explain:</li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>What barriers do you face in implementing what you learned at the activity?</li>
      </ol>
      <a id="RecordCredit"></a>
      <h3>Recording Credit</h3>
      <p>
         It is your responsibility to make sure you not only record that the learner attended, but for how much time. The WSMA's method of
         verification is to have the learner self-report their participation time. If you have a suggestion or would like to use another method,
         contact WSMA CME staff to see if your idea meets the requirement.
      </p>

      <p>
         <em>For example: </em>
      </p>

      <p>
         <strong>OR</strong>
      </p>

      <p>The WSMA has a <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CreditClaimForm">sample online template</a> you may use.</p>

      <p>To help attendees understand how much credit to claim, the following language may be used:</p>

      <p>
         Physicians: The number of credits claimed equals the number of <em>AMA PRA Category 1 Credits</em>&trade; awarded, with one hour of
         participation equaling one <em>AMA PRA Category 1 Credit</em>&trade;. Physicians should claim credit in 15-minute (i.e. 0.25) increments.
         This (activity type) was designated for (number) <em>AMA PRA Category 1 Credit(s)</em>&trade;.
      </p>

      <p>
         All other attendees: Please complete this form so that we may verify your participation in this activity, which was designated for
         <em>AMA PRA Category 1 Credit(s)</em>&trade;.
      </p>

      <p>You may consider attaching the credit claim form to the end of your evaluation as an easy way to ensure physician completion.</p>

      <a id="Certificate"></a>
      <h3>Certificate of Attendance</h3>
      <p>
         A PDF of the official, signed CME attendance certificates will be distributed once all material for the pre-activity documentation has been
