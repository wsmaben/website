		<p>The Medical Officer Collaborative offers the necessary opportunity for physician leaders from hospitals and medical groups to work collaboratively to improve care and make Washington known for its patient safety achievement. These medical officers from throughout Washington state work together on quality and safety initiatives that will improve patient lives and health care delivery, developing statewide strategies and implementation plans. <a href="https://medicalofficercollaborative.org/home/">Learn more about the work of the WSMA/WSHA Medical Officer Collaborative</a>.</p>
