         <strong>
            The WSMA Dyad Leadership Course is a three-day, in-person
            educational workshop for physicians and their administrative dyad
            partners who wish to improve team function and achieve greater
            operational success within their clinical system.
         </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
         Teamwork is necessary to achieve better outcomes. Having the whole team
         on the same page for the right reasons is crucial to drive real change.
         The WSMA Dyad Leadership Course is designed as a working “retreat”
         focusing on three aspects of leadership development:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            Assessment of current individual, dyad, and team function, with
            attention to opportunities for improvement.
         </li>
         <li>
            Construction of a remediation process using classroom-based and
            health care facility-based resources to plan for individual, dyad,
            and team growth.
         </li>
         <li>
            An evaluation of progress toward goals at the completion of the
            course.
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
         This WSMA Dyad Leadership Course develops leadership knowledge and
         skills based on the ongoing operational needs of the physician and
         his/her administrative partner. The course is adapted to fit the
         specific clinical culture of participating teams. At the end of the
         course, participants will have a greater understanding of how to
         enhance leadership and operational success within their clinical
         system.
      </p>
