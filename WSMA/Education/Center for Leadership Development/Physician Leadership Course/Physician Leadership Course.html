            >The WSMA Physician Leadership Course is a 40+ hour hybrid-distance leadership skills-development course for physicians and
            physician assistants who want to know more about health care leadership.</strong
         >
      </p>
      <p>
         Once out of residency, many physicians will find themselves leading a multidisciplinary team charged with delivering the highest
         quality care to our patients. To be an effective team leader, core leadership competencies are required—skills not taught in
         medical school. Without these skills, physicians may find themselves unprepared and overburdened with unexpected responsibilities—a
         recipe for burnout.
      </p>
      <p>
         The WSMA is committed to helping physicians develop the skills they need to thrive professionally in today’s health care
         environment, regardless of the type or size of your organization. Developing core leadership competencies can strengthen clinician
         resilience, improve time and stress management, and help you achieve greater workflow efficiency.
      </p>
      <p>
         The WSMA Physician Leadership Course combines face-to-face and online learning to enable course participants to begin developing
         and honing their leadership skills at their convenience. Designed with a physician's busy schedule in mind, only three in-person
         classes are required; the remainder of the course is conducted online.
      </p>
      <h3>Course details</h3>
      <p>
         The Winter 2021 course will be held March 12-May 21. The in-person classes will be held Friday and Saturday, March 12-13. Course

            <p>
               This is a course for physicians and physician assistants who want to know more about health care leadership. Many physicians
               and PAs who take this course will go on to further training and become leaders and managers in their local clinical care
               settings. The course is a basic "boot camp" to familiarize physicians with the four important components of health care
               leadership: performance improvement, patient safety and high reliability; leadership and management of individuals, teams and
               organizations; planning and finance; and creating and maintaining a personal leadership development plan.
            </p>
            <h3>Course philosophy</h3>
            <p>
               The course is designed from a social-constructivist point of view, which maintains that experienced adult learners do best
               when they work in teams to build new understandings of their previous experience by developing new, better-informed mental
               models. We will work in teams, sometimes face to face and at other times asynchronously, using multimedia resources and
               health care-oriented case scenarios to acquire a basic understanding of leadership, management and quality improvement.
