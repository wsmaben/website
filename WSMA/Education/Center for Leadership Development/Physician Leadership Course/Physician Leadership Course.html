      <strong>
        The WSMA Physician Leadership Course is a 40+ hour hybrid-distance
        leadership skills-development course for physicians and physician
        assistants who want to know more about health care leadership.
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Once out of residency, many physicians will find themselves leading a
      multidisciplinary team charged with delivering the highest quality care to
      our patients. To be an effective team leader, core leadership competencies
      are required—skills not taught in medical school. Without these skills,
      physicians may find themselves unprepared and overburdened with unexpected
      responsibilities—a recipe for burnout.
    </p>
    <p>
      The WSMA is committed to helping physicians develop the skills they need
      to thrive professionally in today’s health care environment, regardless of
      the type or size of your organization. Developing core leadership
      competencies can strengthen clinician resilience, improve time and stress
      management, and help you achieve greater workflow efficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
      The WSMA Physician Leadership Course combines face-to-face and online
      learning to enable course participants to begin developing and honing
      their leadership skills at their convenience. Designed with a physician's
      busy schedule in mind, only three in-person classes are required; the
      remainder of the course is conducted online.
    </p>
    <h3>Course details</h3>
    <p>
      The Fall 2021 course will be held Sept 10-Nov 19. The live sessions will
      be held Friday and Saturday, Sept 10-11 via Zoom. Course participants will
      then have eight weeks of online instruction and interaction, finishing
      with a third live session on Friday, Nov 19. The deadline to register is
      August 13, 2021.
    </p>
    <p>

          This is a course for physicians and physician assistants who want to
          know more about health care leadership. Many physicians and PAs who
          take this course will go on to further training and become leaders and
          managers in their local clinical care settings. The course is a basic
          "boot camp" to familiarize physicians with the four important
          components of health care leadership: performance improvement, patient
          safety and high reliability; leadership and management of individuals,
          teams and organizations; planning and finance; and creating and
          maintaining a personal leadership development plan.
        </p>
        <h3>Course philosophy</h3>
        <p>
          The course is designed from a social-constructivist point of view,
          which maintains that experienced adult learners do best when they work
          in teams to build new understandings of their previous experience by
          developing new, better-informed mental models. We will work in teams,
          sometimes face to face and at other times asynchronously, using
          multimedia resources and health care-oriented case scenarios to
          acquire a basic understanding of leadership, management and quality
          improvement.
