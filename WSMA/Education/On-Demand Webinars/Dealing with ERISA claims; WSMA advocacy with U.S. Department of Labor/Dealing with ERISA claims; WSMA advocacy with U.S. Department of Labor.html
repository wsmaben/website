      <p>Has your practice received a denial on a submitted ERISA claim? The WSMA can help.</p>
      <p>
         In this free webinar, the WSMA and the Seattle office of the U.S. Department of Labor provide an overview of ERISA Title I, explain
         fully-insured vs. self-insured health plans, claims procedures and participants' rights, and the role of the Department of Labor in
         overseeing ERISA arrangements.
      </p>
      <p>
         ERISA, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, affects self-insured health plans. Claims payments and denials with ERISA plans
         are becoming increasingly problematic for physician practices. In years past, only very large companies took on self-insured health care
         coverage; now, insurers are marketing third-party administrator/"administrative services only" to companies as small as 50&ndash;100
         employees. As the employers bear full financial risk, these arrangements are not "insurance" products regulated by the state Office of the
         Insurance Commissioner, meaning the OIC cannot intervene to protect those patients. However, the U.S. Department of Labor does have oversight
         of ERISA arrangements.
