    <h3>COVID-19 Virtual Grand Rounds (Part 5)</h3>
    <p>
      Given that COVID-19 will impact the medical community for the foreseeable
      future, this mini-series focuses on the evolution of the disease,
      management of COVID-19 patients, and our state's response to the
      pandemic—with an emphasis on what frontline physicians need to know. WSMA
      brings you the state's public health leaders—Dr. Kathy Lofy and Dr.
      Charisse Fotinos—for free sessions that will offer the latest information
      on COVID-19 that directly impacts you, your practice and your patients.
      Guest speakers will share their expertise as well. The format will include
      45 minutes of content and 30 minutes for a Q&amp;A discussion with the
      speakers.

      Bill Robertson, president and CEO of MultiCare, discusses the statewide
      collaboration to address Staying Open, Staying Safe issues identified in
      Governor Inslee’s Healthcare Reopening Proclamation 20-24.1. The goal is
      for the Washington healthcare system to remain 1) fully open and operating
      at all levels for all types of care, and 2) safe for both care givers and
      consumers of care. Mr. Robertson outlines the work products of the PPE
      strategic sourcing and distribution workgroup and the COVID-19 testing,
      tracking, tracing, and data management workgroup.

      Department of Labor provide an overview of ERISA Title I, explain
      fully-insured vs. self-insured health plans, claims procedures and
      participants' rights, and the role of the Department of Labor in
      overseeing ERISA arrangements.
    </p>
    <p>
      ERISA, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, affects
      self-insured health plans. Claims payments and denials with ERISA plans
      are becoming increasingly problematic for physician practices. In years
      past, only very large companies took on self-insured health care coverage;
      now, insurers are marketing third-party administrator/"administrative
      services only" to companies as small as 50&ndash;100 employees. As the
      employers bear full financial risk, these arrangements are not "insurance"
      products regulated by the state Office of the Insurance Commissioner,
      meaning the OIC cannot intervene to protect those patients. However, the
      U.S. Department of Labor does have oversight of ERISA arrangements.

    <h2>Mapping Your Path to Value-Based Care</h2>
    <p>
      A mix of traditional and value-based payment complicates day-to-day
      operations. Some processes and services that lead to success under
      traditional fee-for-service payment arrangements can contribute to failure
      under value-based incentives.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this 60-minute webinar, Attune Healthcare Partners, Washington
      consultants and experts in value-based payment, will explain how to map a
      path to optimize earnings and simplify daily operations with a mix of
      traditional and value-based payment methods. You'll also learn about

    <h2>
      The 3 Most Important Benefits of Implementing a Medical Scribe Program
    </h2>
    <p>
      Medical scribes are the best lever to improve physician efficiency and
      clinic performance, patient satisfaction, physician retention and
      recruitment, and clinic revenue. Scribes perform EMR documentation and
      other clerical tasks for the physician. Delegating these tasks to
      appropriately trained scribes frees doctors to perform higher-level tasks,
      making them more efficient and improving their job satisfaction. When
      clinics implement scribe programs, doctors see dramatic reduction in time
      spent performing documentation and other non-medical tasks, reduced wait
      times for patient appointments, improved documentation quality, and better
      relationships with patients.
    </p>
    <p>In this presentation we review:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The costs and benefits of implementing a scribe program</li>
      <li>The differences between in-house and outsourced solutions</li>
      <li>
        And real-world results of case studies in which scribes have been
        deployed

    <h2>Medical Records Management: Solutions for Physician Practices</h2>
    <p>
      A number of variables affect the length of time a physician practice
      should keep a medical record. Factors include state/federal laws, medical
      board policies and the record type (for example, an adult versus a
      pediatric patient). Managing the medical record is an important
      responsibility for all practices especially in this changing environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      This free 90-minute webinar will help you learn about the various rules
      regarding records retention and solutions for your practice to consider.
      We'll also introduce you to Spectrum Information Services Northwest, a
      WSMA-endorsed partner which offers easy and affordable solutions that
      reduce the expense and liability risks of managing your patients' records.

    <p>
      Evidence-based medicine is more than just using clinically-proven
      procedures; equally important is using the evidence to decide what
      <span style="text-decoration: underline">not</span>
      to do. Choosing Wisely&reg; is part of a multi-year effort by the ABIM
      Foundation, along with many national specialty society partners, to help
      physicians become better stewards of our limited health care resources.
      Twenty national organizations representing medical specialists, as well as
      Consumer Reports, have joined with the ABIM Foundation to help physicians,
      patients and other health care stakeholders think and talk about the
      overuse of health care resources. Each specialist organization has
      identified five tests or procedures commonly used in their field for which
      the necessity should usually be questioned and discussed. The resulting
      lists of

    <h2>Medication Reconciliation Following Hospital Discharges</h2>
    <p>
      Repeated studies have found medication errors following hospital discharge
      to be a serious problem. One in eight discharged patients has an adverse
      drug event within three weeks of discharge. Two-thirds of all medication
      errors occur during patient transitions, and over 1.5 million patients
      have a medication error annually, at a cost of $3.5 billion. An immediate
      need post discharge is medication reconciliation. This webinar, originally
      presented on October 3, 2012, presents why and how to efficiently perform

      Intensive Outpatient Care for Patients with Multiple Chronic Illnesses
    </h2>
    <p>
      Everyone talks about patient engagement and bending the cost curve. This
      webinar, originally presented on September 19, 2012, presents practical
      steps on how to actually achieve these goals in a way that significantly
      improves patient care outcomes by focusing intensive outpatient care on
      high-risk persons with multiple chronic conditions. While this is not a
      new concept, widespread adoption of these evidence-based approaches has
      been slow to catch on until very recently. This webinar spotlights
      programs underway in California, Oregon and also in Washington that have
      demonstrated their effectiveness in improving care and reducing costs.

    <h2>
      Using Results from Patient Experience Surveys to Improve Patient Care
    </h2>
    <p>
      This lunchtime webinar, originally presented on May 24, 2012, presents the
      results of the recent survey of patient experience conducted in the Puget
      Sound region by the Puget Sound Health Alliance, and explains how those
      results can be used to improve practice performance to better meet the
      needs of patients. Patient experience results were released on May 11,
      2012 for 40 Puget Sound-area medical groups with 156 clinic locations
      (clinics with 3 or more primary care providers). Patient experience
      definitely matters to patients; it's most often how they define "quality."
      Patients with positive experiences return; patients with negative
      experiences often find a different physician. Further, positive patient
      experience has been shown to correlate with improved clinical outcomes.

      The Washington Patient-Centered Medical Home Collaborative - Lessons
      Learned
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Patient-Centered Medical Home Collaborative was a learning process for
      medical teams to improve primary care for their patients. From September
      2009 through September 2011, 32 teams in Washington created and operated
      patient-centered medical homes, under a project jointly sponsored by the
      Washington State Department of Health and the Washington Academy of Family
      Physicians. In a medical home, the physician and care team build strong
      relationships with the patient and the patient's family. The team
      coordinates care with specialists or other health providers.
      Patient-centered care makes the patient a partner in health care
      decisions. This webinar pdf presents the lessons learned from this two
      year collaborative.

    <h2>End of Life Conversations in Medical Care</h2>
    <p>
      Some of the most important, and challenging, conversations physicians can
      have with their patients involve planning for, and clarifying patients
      values about, end-of-life care decisions. The timing and structure of
      these conversations, and the ways to successfully engage the patient (and
      family members as appropriate) in what are often difficult and emotional
      decisions, was the subject of this webinar pdf, presented by Linda
      Wrede-Seaman, MD, FAAFP, FACEP, FAAHPM, a Yakima palliative medicine
      specialist.

    <h2>An Overview of Care Coordination Essentials</h2>
    <p>
      This webinar pdf presented an in-depth overview of the essentials for
      effective care coordination, giving participants a practical, four-part
      framework for improving how care is coordinated among clinical partners.
      Focused on the patient-centered medical home model of care delivery, the
      framework begins with taking responsibility for the care your patients
      receive regardless of setting and includes identifying the best practice
      service partners, building relationships with these partners, providing
      patient logistical support, and developing formal agreements and
      connections to improve care coordination. Ed Wagner, MD, MPH, FACP, a
      general internist/ epidemiologist and Director of the MacColl Institute
      for Healthcare Innovation at the Group Health Cooperative Center for
      Health Studies presented.

    <h2>Reducing Health Disparities: Collecting Standardized Data</h2>
    <p>
      This webinar pdf presented a hands-on, practical approach to collecting
      and using standardized patient data about race, ethnicity and language to
      measure and reduce disparities in your practice. Although numerous focused
      studies have documented persistent differences in outcomes for minority
      patients, most medical practices are currently unable to quantify if
      disparities exist in health outcomes for their patients. Marcia Wilson,
      PhD, and Christina Rowland, MPH, of the Robert Wood Johnson
      Foundation&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Aligning Forces for Quality Project were
      co-presenters.
