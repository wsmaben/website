    <h2>If physicians don't lead, others will</h2>
    <p>Dear Colleagues,</p>

          As clinicians, we have an essential leadership role to play in redesigning complex healthcare delivery. Over the last two decades,
          both our communities and the medical profession have recognized that the US healthcare system often falls short in meeting
          patients' and our own expectations for safety, quality, and efficiency. This disappointing performance persists and has been
          challenging to solve, despite the best intentions of all parties involved. Quality improvement is hard and complex, but essential.
          The financial viability and success of hospitals and physician practices will depend on their ability to improve quality, safety
          and value to patients and payers.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      Physicians must lead the transformation of care delivery systems to fulfill the expectations of our patients. Responsibility for care
      improvements cannot be delegated to administrators and insurers. Unfortunately, many physicians didn't receive training in medical
      school on how to lead quality improvement projects. However, with the right training, physicians can acquire these skills at any
      career stage and can guide healthcare organizations with the optimal approach to safe and effective care delivery.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the WSMA, we have been working to address this challenge and I am pleased to announce a new professional development course for
      physicians, physician assistants, and other members of the health care team. In partnership with the University of Washington Center
      for Scholarship in Patient Care Quality and Safety, the WSMA has designed a 14-week hybrid course to equip you to lead and participate
      in quality improvement projects in your organization.
    </p>
    <p>We hope to see you and your colleagues at the course.</p>
