      <h1>Quality Improvement: A Tool for Transformation</h1>
      <p>
         Physicians are critical in leading the transformation of care delivery systems to fulfill the duty to our patients. Many physicians have not
         received training in medical school on how to lead quality improvement projects. With the right training, physicians can acquire these skills
         at any career stage and can guide health care organizations to deliver safe and effective care.
      </p>
      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>
         This 14-week hybrid professional development course is designed in partnership with the University of Washington Center for Scholarship in
         Patient Care Quality and Safety. This course will equip you to lead and participate in quality improvement projects in your organization.

            <p>
               As clinicians, we have an essential leadership role to play in redesigning complex healthcare delivery. Over the last two decades, both
               our communities and the medical profession have recognized that the US healthcare system often falls short in meeting patients' and our
               own expectations for safety, quality, and efficiency. This disappointing performance persists and has been challenging to solve,
               despite the best intentions of all parties involved. Quality improvement is hard and complex, but essential. The financial viability
               and success of hospitals and physician practices will depend on their ability to improve quality, safety and value to patients and
               payers.
            </p>
            <p>
               Physicians must lead the transformation of care delivery systems to fulfill the expectations of our patients. Responsibility for care
               improvements cannot be delegated to administrators and insurers. Unfortunately, many physicians didn't receive training in medical
               school on how to lead quality improvement projects. However, with the right training, physicians can acquire these skills at any career
               stage and can guide healthcare organizations with the optimal approach to safe and effective care delivery.
            </p>
            <p>
               At the WSMA, we have been working to address this challenge and I am pleased to announce a new professional development course for
               physicians, physician assistants, and other members of the health care team. In partnership with the University of Washington Center
               for Scholarship in Patient Care Quality and Safety, the WSMA has designed a 14-week hybrid course to equip you to lead and participate
               in quality improvement projects in your organization.
            </p>
            <p>We hope to see you and your colleagues at the course.</p>
