Get to Know Your Legislators
</h1>
<!-- ************************** iPart ****************************** -->
<p><strong>After the legislative session ends, lawmakers return to their home districts. This is the perfect time to start building relationships with your elected representatives and start talking about policies that are affecting you, your employees, your business, and your patients.</strong></p>
<p>Get started building relationships in your legislative district using the resources below.</p>

<p>Relationships are the lifeblood of advocacy work. Your WSMA lobbyists and representatives work in Olympia to develop deep relationships with policymakers, government agencies, and others working in the health care arena.</p>
<p>What gives an organization a “superpower” are the relationships that member advocates work to build within the legislative districts where they live and work. The power is found in the constituents … that’s you!</p>
<p>Legislators want to hear from their constituents <em>in their districts</em>. They want to know how the policies that they debated and passed during legislative session affects constituents back home. They want to see and hear from the people who live and work in their district about how a particular problem or issue is affecting a particular group or organization or business within their communities.</p>
<p>As a physician, you are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Responsible for the health and well-being of your patients (their constituents).</li>
    <li>A business owner in their district, responsible for employees (their constituents).</li>
</ul>
<p>When legislators hear from and meet with constituents while they are at home in their districts, it serves as a powerful advocacy tool. Because often what a policymaker sees, hears, and learns from constituents in their home districts will shape their decisions, thoughts and actions when they travel back to Olympia for the next legislative session.</p>
<p>Use the Legislator Meeting Tool Kit on this page to help you build (or deepen) relationships with your elected officials and talk about issues after legislative session.</p>
