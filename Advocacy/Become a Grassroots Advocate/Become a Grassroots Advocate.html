<h1 class="mobileShow">Become a Grassroots Advocate</h1>
<p><strong>The WSMA works year-round to advocate for your interests and those of your patients. You, too, can become a year-round advocate to help further policies to support your practice and patients.</strong></p>
<p>Four steps to becoming a year-round grassroots advocate:</p>
<h3>#1. Build relationships with your legislators</h3>
<p>What a policymaker learns from constituents in their home districts can shape their decisions when they make policy decisions, many of which stand to impact you, your practice, and your patients. Legislators want to hear from their constituents. <a href="[@]WSMA/Advocacy/Become_a_Grassroots_Advocate/Get_to_Know_Your_Legislators/Get_to_Know_Your_Legislators.aspx">Learn how to build relationships with your elected officials and talk about issues after legislative session</a>.</p>
<h3>#2. Attend the WSMA Legislative Summit</h3>
<p>Timed to coincide with the state legislative session, this yearly event gives WSMA members an opportunity to talk with lawmakers about top legislative issues identified by the WSMA as benefiting the most from physician perspective. <a href="[@]WSMA/Events/Legislative_Summit/Legislative_Summit.aspx">Learn more about the WSMA Legislative Summit and plan now to attend</a>.</p>
<h3>#3. Respond to WSMA’s calls to action</h3>
<p>In the digital age, email has emerged as a precise, powerful advocacy tool. Hearing from constituents during the state legislative session can help inform their decision-making on policy being proposed.</p>
<p>During the 2019 legislative session, the WSMA sent out 13 calls to action resulting in physicians sending more than 6,000 messages to state legislators. Make sure you’re receiving these important calls to action by verifying that your contact information at the WSMA is up to date.

<h3>#4. Provide testimony at public hearings</h3>
<p>Public testimony during the state legislative session is an important part of policymaking. It’s one way that legislators get up to speed on the issues confronting them. As a physician, your testimony on health care policy lends gravity and expertise that can help determine the fate of a bill. <a href="[@]WSMA/Advocacy/Become_a_Grassroots_Advocate/Tips_for_Testifying_at_a_Public_Hearing/Tips_for_Testifying_at_a_Public_Hearing.aspx">The WSMA provides tips for testifying in Olympia and is looking for willing physician experts to lend their expertise during public hearings</a>.</p>
