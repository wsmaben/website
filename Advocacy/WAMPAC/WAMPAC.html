<!-- Introduction -->
<h1>WAMPAC</h1>
<p>
WAMPAC (Washington Medical Political Action Committee) is the nonpartisan political campaign arm of the WSMA, established to help identify and support candidates for political office whose priorities align with the house of medicine. In recent years, more than 95 percent of the candidates we've supported have won their campaigns, and the relationships we built on the campaign trail have helped
translate to the kind of policy victories that make a difference for physicians and patients.</p>
<p>The WSMA works on the federal level with AMPAC, the AMA's political action committee. AMPAC supports medicine-friendly candidates across the country who are seeking election to the U.S. Congress.

<h2>Campaigns are more important than ever&mdash;and so is your support for WAMPAC </h2>
<p>Recent events have shown that politics are more important than ever to physicians and the patients they serve. It's crucial for the WSMA to be effective and influential on political campaigns&mdash;because as we all know, it's easier to help elect someone who agrees with you than it is to change the mind of a politician who doesn't.   </p>
<h2>You can help by joining WAMPAC's Diamond Club </h2>
<p>The WSMA reintroduced the WAMPAC Diamond Club in 2015 to give physicians an opportunity to increase their investment&mdash;and their participation&mdash;in our campaign activities, with members receiving recognition, special election updates and exclusive opportunities to connect with elected officials. The response to the Diamond Club has been overwhelming: To date, we've received well over 200 contributions, raising nearly $100,000 for WAMPAC.</p>
<p>
If politics and policy are important to you, please consider joining your physician colleagues as a member of the WAMPAC Diamond Club. If you have
questions about the Diamond Club or your membership status, contact Sean Graham at <a href="mailto:sean@wsma.org">sean@wsma.org</a>.</p>

<h2>The WAMPAC Legislator Report Card</h2>
<p>Want to know how your state legislators supported the house of medicine before you decide whether to support them? WAMPAC can help.</p>
<p>
One of the many ways WAMPAC brings value to WSMA members is providing details on your legislators' track record on issues important to you and your patients. Each year, WAMPAC publishes a "report card" showing how legislators voted on WSMA's priority bills, included as part of the yearly WSMA Legislative Report mailed to all members at the conclusion of the state legislative session. If you have questions about the report card or other issues related to elections, contact Sean Graham at <a href="mailto:sean@wsma.org">sean@wsma.org</a></p>
