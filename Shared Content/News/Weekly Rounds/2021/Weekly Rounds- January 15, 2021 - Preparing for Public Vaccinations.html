      <h2>Preparing for Public Vaccinations</h2>
      <p>Jennifer Hanscom, Executive Director/CEO</p>
      <p>
         Washington state is on the cusp of moving beyond health care into
         vaccinating the wider public, with the Department of Health
         <a
            href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/Newsroom/Articles/ID/2565/COVID-19-vaccine-distribution-update-from-the-Washington-State-Department-of-Health"
         >
            moving up its timeline
         </a>
         for Phase 1B of its vaccine rollout. While much is still to be
         determined, including the effect of potential increased federal
         support, here are some developments this week that can help you assist
         with the vaccine rollout.
      </p>
      <h3>Phase 1B and impact of changing federal guidance</h3>
      <p>
         The state has broken its Phase 1B into four tiers. At this time, the
         Department of Health has not decided if it will align with the updated
         guidance announced by the federal government this week. State public
         health officials are also waiting to hear from the Biden administration
         on what its plan is, and if it aligns with the new federal
         announcements.
      </p>
      <h4>1B1 (Tier 1)</h4>
      <ul>
         <li>All people 70 years and older.</li>
         <li>
            People 50 years and older who live in multigenerational households.
         </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>1B2 (Tier 2)</h4>
      <ul>
         <li>
            High-risk critical workers 50 years and older who work in congregate
            settings:
            <ul>
               <li>
                  Agriculture; food processing; grocery stores; K-12 (teachers
                  and school staff); child care; corrections, prisons, jails, or
                  detention facilities (staff); public transit; fire; law
                  enforcement.
               </li>
            </ul>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>1B3 (Tier 3)</h4>
      <ul>
         <li>
            People 16 years or older with two or more comorbidities or
            underlying conditions.
         </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>1B4 (Tier 4)</h4>
      <ul>
         <li>
            High-risk critical workers in congregate settings under 50 years
            old.
         </li>
         <li>
            People, staff, and volunteers of all ages in congregate living
            settings:
            <ul>
               <li>
                  Correctional facilities; group homes for people with
                  disabilities; shelters for people experiencing homelessness.
               </li>
            </ul>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Regulatory flexibilities for vaccine providers</h3>
      <p>
         To encourage more practice and clinic enrollment in the federal
         COVID-19 Vaccination Program and assistance in public vaccinations, the
         Department of Health has confirmed this week that:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            The activities of everyone engaged in the operation of vaccination
            clinics (and other vaccine efforts related to the COVID-19 response)
            is afforded the liability protections granted under the federal PREP
            Act.
         </li>
         <li>
            Reporting vaccine administration information to the Washington
            Immunization Information System (WIIS) satisfies any reporting that
            might be required in an electronic medical record to capture that a
            vaccine has been administered.
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
         For details on these flexibilities, see this
         <a
            href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/Portals/1/Documents/1600/coronavirus/PREP-act-authorization-vaccination-program.pdf"

            Department of Health notice

         . To enroll your practice or organization in the COVID-19 Vaccination
         Program, visit the
         <a
            href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/COVID19/HealthcareProviders/VaccineInformationforHealthcareProviders"
         >
            DOH website
         </a>
         . Check that page for a detailed FAQ. In addition, the WSMA has learned
         the following:
      </p>
      <ol>
         <li>
            <strong>
               When will vaccines be delivered to outpatient practices that have
               signed up to be COVID-19 vaccine providers?
            </strong>
            Similar to the state's childhood vaccine program, after the
            Department of Health approves a vaccine order for a provider,
            vaccines are delivered via FedEx from a central CDC warehouse
            directly to each provider facility, according to the facility's
            office hours.
         </li>
         <li>
            <strong>How are vaccines ordered?</strong>
            Currently the program is placing orders for providers based off
            information shared through a weekly survey. In the next few weeks,
            the DOH will transition to ordering through the Washington
            Immunization Information System (WIIS).
         </li>
         <li>
            <strong>
               Are there plans in place for mass vaccination sites?
            </strong>
            The Department of Health says that mass vaccination plans are in
            process.
         </li>

      <h3>Volunteers needed for mass vaccination clinics</h3>
      <p>
         The state is calling for more clinician volunteers to assist with its
         COVID-19 response, including mass vaccination clinics. Register with
         the

      <h3>Finishing Phase 1A</h3>
      <p>
         This week, the Department of Health called on all workers in health
         care settings to get their COVID-19 vaccine as soon as possible. The
         DOH is asking workers in health care settings to use its Phase Finder
         tool at
         <a href="https://form.findyourphasewa.org/210118771253954">
            findyourphasewa.com
         </a>
         to locate a vaccine provider site and to confirm eligibility when
         presenting at the site.
      </p>
      <p>
         Phase Finder will launch broadly on Jan. 18. The tool will be available
         in multiple languages and is intended to be used to provide eligibility
         confirmation on site.
      </p>
      <p>
         Local health jurisdictions and some county medical societies are
         assisting in the vaccine rollout. Check your

         .)
      </p>
      <p>
         The Department of Health has clarified that some communities may move
         into phase 1B before other communities have finished 1A, in recognition
         of the differing makeup and needs of localities. For in-depth guidance
         for all released phases, see the Department of Health's

         While information and guidance are developing daily, the WSMA is
         meeting regularly with the Department of Health, the Washington State
         Hospital Association, and other stakeholders to assist with the largest
         mass vaccination effort in recent history. If you have additional
