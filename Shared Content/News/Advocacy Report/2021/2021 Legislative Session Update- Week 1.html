         <h2>2021 Legislative Session Update: Week 1</h2>

         <h3>Overview</h3>
         <p>
            The 2021 legislative session convened on Monday, Jan. 11 for a
            virtual "long session," lasting 105 days. During session, the WSMA
            Outreach and Advocacy Report will be disseminated on a weekly basis
            and will include updates about WSMA's advocacy efforts and
            opportunities for engagement. Legislators will spend the majority of
            the first few weeks of session in virtual committee hearings, which
            will be streamed live and archived on
            <a href="https://www.tvw.org/">TVW</a> for your viewing.
         </p>
         <p>
            The Washington State National Guard was dispatched to the Capitol in
            advance of the first day of the 2021 legislative session,
            establishing a fenced perimeter around several buildings as rallies
            had been planned throughout the week. Gov. Jay Inslee has now
            extended these security measures at the Capitol through the
            presidential inauguration on Jan. 20. State legislators and staff
            are largely working remotely, although some members were needed on
            campus this week to vote on rules establishing the ability to
            convene session virtually.
         </p>
         <p>
            Gov. Inslee gave the first State of the State address since his
            reelection in November, which focused on the COVID-19 pandemic, the
            state's response efforts, and his 2021 legislative agenda. Following
            public health guidelines and new security measures, the governor
            delivered the address
            <a
               href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery&amp;v=FaOyBG65K1I"
               ><strong>via video.</strong> </a
            >New members were sworn in, notably Sen. T'wina Nobles from the 28th
            Legislative District who will be the Senate's only Black member and
            Jessica Bateman from the 22nd Legislative District who will serve as
            the new vice chair of the House Health Care Committee.
         </p>
         <p>
            In partnership with a coalition of organizations representing the
            physician and physician assistant communities, WSMA sent the
            attached letter to all members of the Legislature. The letter
            outlines WSMA's top budget priority for the 2021 legislative session
            &ndash; restoration of the primary care, pediatric, and behavioral
            health Medicaid rate reimbursement adjustments that passed during
            the 2020 legislative session and were subsequently vetoed as a
            result of the pandemic. WSMA has dedicated years of advocacy on this
            issue, and it is viewed as the first step toward a broader rate
            adjustment for all care delivered through the state's Medicaid
            program.
         </p>
         <p>
            Later in the week, the Legislature held its first virtual committee
            hearings, testing the ability for the Legislature to perform
            business as usual in a virtual setting. While many bills were
            prefiled for introduction, there is a backlog at the Code Reviser's
            Office (the official bill drafting arm of the Legislature) that will
            impact the ability for bills to get scheduled for committee
            hearings. This may result in increased work sessions, such as
            Friday's work session on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on
            health care delivery in the Senate Health and Long Term Care
            Committee.
