            WSMA President Urges Patience as State Begins to Vaccinate the
            Public
         </h2>
         <p>
            SEATTLE – Washington State Medical Association President Nathan
            Schlicher, MD, JD, issued the following statement in response to
            Gov. Jay Inslee's announced changes to Washington state's COVID-19
            vaccine rollout:
         </p>
         <p>
            "The WSMA is hopeful that the changes announced by the governor will
            help quicken the pace of our state's COVID-19 vaccine rollout. The
            state's multipronged approach, increasing eligibility and capacity,
            organizing mass vaccination clinics, and bringing private partners
            on board, reflects the "all-hands-on-deck" moment, and Washington's
            physicians stand at the ready.
         </p>
         <p>
            "I am so proud and grateful for the physicians and other health care
            providers who have already stepped up to serve as volunteers or as
            vaccine providers. The governor made it clear that because this is
            an aggressive effort, we will need as many as possible to offer your
            time and talents to this effort. I encourage physicians and health
            care providers to volunteer at
            <a href="https://WAServ.org">WAServ.org</a>
            .
         </p>
         <p>
            "And to all Washingtonians: I want to echo the governor's call for
            patience. Vaccinating everyone in our state is a massive undertaking
            and many pieces still need to fall in place—including more vaccine
            supplies. This is an extraordinary effort that will require
            coordination from federal, state, and local governments, as well as
            private industry. We ask the public to be patient and understanding
            during this mammoth undertaking. Making sure you are getting the
            care and protection you need is our top priority.
         </p>
         <p>
            "To learn more about your eligibility and where you can get
            vaccinated, visit
            <a href="http://FindYourPhaseWA.org">FindYourPhaseWA.org</a>
            . And remember: Eligibility will not automatically mean you'll have
            your first dose right away—you may need to wait. Be patient, and
            trust that Washington's public health officials, your physicians,
            and health care community are doing everything they can to keep you
            safe from this virus, working to ensure you get your vaccine as soon
            as possible."
