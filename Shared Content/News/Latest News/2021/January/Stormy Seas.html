      <h2>Stormy Seas</h2>

      <p>
         When the COVID-19 pandemic exploded in early March, Ki Shin, MD, was on
         vacation in Hawaii with his wife, also a physician, taking a break from
         their practice in the small town of Montesano. "We got there on Monday
         and then the governor's restriction happened," Dr. Shin recalls. "All
         of a sudden, we were out of town and my staff was freaking out. It was
         an immediate crisis. Not a lot of information was available to us, and
         we had a lot of scared people, staff and patients included."
      </p>
      <p>
         Upon their return home, the Shins immediately set about trying to
         stabilize their practice. Faced with a 40% drop in appointments, the
         couple took a 50% pay cut so that they could keep their staff on
         payroll.
      </p>
      <p>
         "For us not to get paid for a couple of months was totally doable, but
         that was not true for the staff," says Dr. Shin.
      </p>
      <p>
         After a rough few months, some of the financial pressures eased. The
         Shins obtained a loan under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), the
         part of the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act
         designed to help small businesses. They also received $30,000 from
         Medicare, which covered the practice's overhead for a month.
      </p>
      <p>
         Eventually, patients started returning, and Dr. Shin's practice is
         stable again, but still not entirely recovered. "The [patient] volume
         is coming up, but it's not back to normal," he says. "It's about 90% of
         what it was previous to COVID."
      </p>
      <h3>Survey answers detail challenges</h3>
      <p>
         The recovery of Dr. Shin's practice, and other practices around
         Washington, is a hopeful sign. However, the new normal falls short of
         the old one. Moreover, the ever-changing course of the pandemic,
         including the potential for another lockdown, makes the outlook for
         practices in Washington uncertain at best.
      </p>
      <p>
         "Physicians are doing okay right now, but they are still so
         vulnerable," says Jennifer Hanscom, executive director and CEO of the
         WSMA. "The ground they're standing on is shaky. There might be an
         earthquake brewing underneath."
      </p>
      <p>
         Shawn Andrews, primary care medical director at Summit Pacific Medical
         Center in Elma, says that the effects of the pandemic seem to vary by
         type of practice.
      </p>
      <p>
         "In terms of finances, the larger practices will survive," she says.
         "Our budgets are not pretty but we're viable, and that's not a given
         for everyone this year. We're not in the same boat as folks in private
         practice or even some other critical access hospitals."
      </p>
      <p>
         A fall 2020 survey of WSMA members found that the pandemic has taken a
         significant toll on practices, making their financial viability a real
         concern. Of 69 members from a range of practices and specialties who
         responded to the survey, more than half reported a temporary reduction
         in compensation because of the pandemic. Nearly half the survey
         respondents said that they had to lay off or furlough staff, including
         physicians.
      </p>
      <p>
         Almost a quarter of the respondents said that the financial impact of
         the pandemic on their practice is between $500,000 and $1 million.
         Those figures echo a national survey of 3,500 physicians conducted by
         the AMA last summer, which found practice revenue dropped by roughly
         one-third.
      </p>
      <p>
         While the worst of the pandemic appears to be over, the ripple effects
         continue. The vast majority of the physicians who responded to the WSMA
         survey said that their patient volume was down compared to before the
         pandemic, with more than a third saying it was down between 25% and
         75%. Even more troubling was that fact that more than 40% reported
         having a month or less of cash on hand to pay operating expenses. The
         WSMA benchmark is 18 weeks.
      </p>
      <h3>
         Extra costs, curtailed services drive need for more financial help
      </h3>
      <p>
         As it did for Dr. Shin's practice, the federal PPP loan provided a
         financial lifeline for many practices.
      </p>
      <p>
         "Luckily we got one of the PPP loans," says Juliette Erickson, MD, a
         physician in a private practice in Grays Harbor. "That helped us
         tremendously and got us over the hump. We stopped having weekly
         meetings on how to pay the next paycheck and started focusing on
         medicine again."
      </p>
      <p>
         However, as much as the loans helped, their benefit was limited. More
         than 80% of the physicians in the WSMA survey said that additional
         financial support would be helpful. In part, that's because new safety
         protocols have also meant more expenses.
      </p>
      <p>
         Chelsea Unruh, MD, a physician at Yelm Family Medicine, says that the
         expenses related to COVID-19 requirements have added up. Like other
         clinics, Yelm Family Medicine does initial screenings of patients in
         its parking lot, but the costs don't stop there.
      </p>
      <p>
         "We have had to rebuild our back parking lot for these car visits,"
         says Dr. Unruh. "We have had to outfit our front desk with shields. We
         are investing in rapid testing and signing contracts for long-term use
         of specific machines."
      </p>
      <p>
         Then there is the extra expense of additional personal protective
         equipment. "The cost of PPE went up," notes Hanscom. Now practices are
         having to bear the costs of full PPE, masks, and sanitizers that
         previously were used much more sparingly.
      </p>
      <p>
         Like Dr. Unruh, Dr. Erickson also sees clients with COVID-19 symptoms
         in the clinic parking lot. "I'm dressed in full PPE," she says. "It's
         not the best way to see an ill person, but it's the best we can do and
         still protect our staff and patients."
      </p>
      <p>
         The need to sanitize exam rooms thoroughly between patient visits can
         also have a direct impact on patient volume. "We decreased the number
         of patients we're seeing per hour," says Dr. Shin. "I was able to see
         four patients an hour, but with the cleaning between visits, we chose
         to limit it to three patients per hour."
      </p>
      <p>
         Even with such precautions in place, some staff still have to
         quarantine because they were exposed to the virus outside of work.
      </p>
      <p>
         "The other income challenge has been the loss of time from our staff,
         from exposures or from being ill themselves," says Dr. Unruh. "None of
         those exposures happened at work, but we don't get to control the
         private lives of our staff. To exclude someone for 14 days because they
         made a poor choice has been rough on morale and staffing."
      </p>
      <p>
         To protect staff and patients, some practices have curbed services,
         including Dr. Shin's. "In Montesano, there are no blood draw labs, so
         lots of patients were coming into our clinic even though [the labs]
         were for someone else," Dr. Shin says. The practice eliminated that
         service, forcing patients in the area to travel farther for it. Dr.
         Erickson says that she is referring more patients to the ER because her
         clinic lacks the proper PPE to treat suspected COVID-19 patients.
      </p>
      <p>
         But Dr. Andrews says that patient volume at her hospital's ER, as well
         as its urgent care clinics, is still down significantly. "Many people
         wait until they are very ill to seek services, and often suffer much
         worse outcomes," she says. Nonetheless, she says that larger practices
         have been better positioned to withstand the pressures from the
         pandemic for a variety of reasons, including business plans less
         impacted by long term drops in volumes, better PPE availability, and
         space to separate well patients from symptomatic ones.
      </p>
      <h3>Telehealth use soars</h3>
      <p>
         The pandemic accelerated several trends that were already underway.
         Chief among these has been the growth of telehealth. Three-quarters of
         the physicians in the WSMA survey said that they implemented telehealth
         as a result of the pandemic.
      </p>
      <p>
         "We had never done telehealth before," says Dr. Unruh. "Then suddenly
         we had half a day per provider devoted to telehealth visits."
      </p>
      <p>
         As helpful as telehealth has proven, it has its drawbacks. In rural
         areas, internet connections can be spotty, if patients have broadband
         service at all.
      </p>
      <p>
         "It's hard to do telehealth where people don't have iPads or iPhones,"
         says Dr. Erickson.
      </p>
      <p>
         For Dr. Erickson, telehealth has also inadvertently caused a staffing
         problem. One of the three doctors in her practice began doing
         telehealth at the start of the coronavirus outbreak as a way of
         bringing income into the practice and fell in love with it. She has
         accepted a full-time job as a telehealth physician and will be leaving
         the practice.
      </p>
      <p>
         "This is her way of moving with her career, but she would never have
         found that job if we were not financially struggling in the first
         place," says Dr. Erickson.
      </p>
      <p>
         Moreover, as useful as telehealth has proven, its long-term future as a
         viable option is still in doubt. "CMS holds the key for that," says Dr.
         Andrews. "CMS will decide what we can and can't get paid to do." If
         telehealth is not reimbursed or not reimbursed at a reasonable rate,
         practices will not be able to sustain it. Accordingly, the WSMA has
         made telehealth reimbursement a priority for its advocacy efforts in
         the 2021 state legislative session.
      </p>
      <h3>Independent practices face tough challenges</h3>
      <p>
         Among the other changes hastened were retirement decisions. "We have a
         group of anesthesiologists who are in their late 50s to late 60s," says
         Brian Nyquist, MD, a partner at Olympic Anesthesia in Bremerton. "We
         had several people who were close to retirement that retired. We knew
         it was coming, but it's not like you can hire people before you need
         them."
      </p>
      <p>
         The flip side of the retirements, says Dr. Nyquist, is that the
         "business kerfuffle of COVID" has made recruiting easier. While
         previous attempts to recruit were uphill battles, he says that there
         are more physicians applying for open positions at his practice. He
         believes that because of COVID-19, "a lot of corporate owners,
         management services, and practices have clamped down on people and
         contracts," leading physicians to look for new opportunities.
      </p>
      <p>
         Whether that applies to rural practices is an open question.
         "Recruiting is incredibly challenging, but more physicians are
         realizing that independent practices are a joy to work in because you
         are more autonomous," says Dr. Erickson.
      </p>
      <p>
         However, the financial pressures of the past year may make it harder
         for independent practices to survive. "There's been a nationwide trend
         away from private groups," says Dr. Nyquist. "We are privileged to
         continue to be a private group. For now we're positioned pretty well,
         but there are lots of pressures&mdash;most of them financial, some
         societal&mdash;that want to drive physicians to work for hospitals. I
         fear that this is probably going to exacerbate that."
      </p>
      <p>
         Even when a vaccine is available, the effects of the pandemic will
         still be felt. "For the next year, I don't see how we don't do things
         we're doing now, like not have a waiting room," says Dr. Shin. "I don't
         think we're going to change the number of patients we serve per hour. I
         think we're looking at this as a long- term issue."
      </p>
      <p>
         While the financial situation for Washington physicians had stabilized
         by year's end, the specter of another spike in coronavirus cases still
         haunts practices. "If we went back to a dark winter where we couldn't
         even see patients in the office, we would absolutely struggle again,"
         says Dr. Erickson. "It keeps you up at night."
      </p>
      <p>
         Still, she remains committed to keeping the clinic afloat. "We've been
         here 35 years, and there are literally not many options in town," she
         says. "The most important thing is how we continue to do our work."
