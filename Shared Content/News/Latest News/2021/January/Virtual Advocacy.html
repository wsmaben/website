Fueled by pandemic social distancing requirements, Washington state’s 2021 legislative session will be like none other.
<p>
As with so many other institutions, the 2021 session of the Washington State Legislature has been fundamentally changed by the coronavirus pandemic. No one thinks it’s a good idea to put hundreds of people together in a room for hours a day over several weeks.
</p>

<p>
So, the structure of this year’s session will be quite different. It will be conducted largely—or entirely—remotely, and the Capitol campus will be closed to the public.
</p>
<p>
Due to the remote nature of the session, fewer bills will likely be considered, with a focus on the state budget and responding to the pandemic. Given the public’s outpouring of support for health care workers, it might seem that this would be the year to shoot for the moon in terms of asking the legislature for health care funding.
</p>

<p>
That would absolutely be true if there was a surplus of cash.
</p>

<p>
“The state’s budget outlook has improved somewhat from the nadir in the spring, but there remains a revenue shortfall,” says WSMA Government Affairs Director Sean Graham. “Actions will need to be taken to keep the budget in balance in the short term and the longer outlook our top priority in the budget realm is staving off any cuts that would impact access to care for the state’s patients.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m grateful we represent the individual physician because we can put a human face on the situation and speak for people who were racing in to solve the problem,” says WSMA Executive Director/CEO Jennifer Hanscom. “That’s an added benefit.”
</p>

<p>
Even with the sympathy that physicians and other health care providers have garnered from policymakers, any number of tax increases are likely to be proposed in the 2021 session and some will impact physicians. Among WSMA’s legislative priorities this year is ensuring the financial viability of practices, including opposing tax increases that will unduly impact the physician community.
</p>

<p>
“We know that virtually all our state’s businesses have been impacted by the pandemic, but that’s particularly true of physician practices and medical groups,” Graham says. “Most physician practices have had a substantial loss of patient volume and some are teetering on the brink financially.”
</p>

<h3>Advancing telemedicine</h3>
<p>
The top policy issue for the WSMA this year relates to increasing the availability of telemedicine. Washington state has been a leader in telemedicine policy, but more can be done. For example, the state’s telemedicine coverage is limited to services that require a patient to have internet access.
</p>

<p>
“A lot of our state doesn’t have access to reliable broadband,” Graham explains. “We need insurance coverage for services offered over the phone. We also need to make sure there’s reliable broadband; it’s a health equity and education issue. The pandemic has made it clear that access to the internet isn’t a luxury; it’s a necessity.”
</p>
<p>
In the regulatory realm, the WSMA will be working to address telemedicine reimbursement inequities.
</p>
<p>
“We found out that some of the insurers are trying to play games with the reimbursement parity requirement passed by the Legislature last year,” he says. “We’ll be working to ensure that payment parity means just that—services are reimbursed the same whether they’re delivered in person or via telemedicine.”
</p>
<h3>Monitoring scope of practice</h3>
<p>
The WSMA also will be paying close attention this year to attempts to promote inappropriate scope of practice increases.
</p>
<p>
“Just about every provider advocacy group with a presence in Olympia will be
bringing a scope of practice increase in 2021, most of which will have ostensible ties to the pandemic,” Graham explains. “As an example, we know of several provider groups that will look to be granted prescriptive authority or to have their prescriptive authority increased.
</p>

<p> “They have wanted it for years,” Graham says. “They’ll come in 2021 and say, ‘There’s this need for access to care. Physicians are overwhelmed. Let us take this off their hands.’ When the WSMA looks at those proposals, our lens is balancing access to care with patient safety. We want to make sure any scope of practice increase would include sufficient training to ensure quality of care.” </p>
<p>
WSMA President Nathan Schlicher, MD, JD, MBA, is more pointed in his position on the issue.
</p>
<p>
“We believe that if you want to be a doctor, you should go to medical school,” says Dr. Schlicher, who also is a former Washington state senator. “We value all our fellow professionals and we want them to be an incredibly important part of the team, but physicians should lead the team and people should practice within their scopes.”
</p>

<h3>Facing structural racism</h3>
<p>
In light of the global protests against racism, the WSMA is taking a strong stand in this year’s legislative session to promote health equity and racial justice. To that end, the association is taking the rare stance to advocate for having professional boards develop continuing medical education for physicians and other health care providers to address structural racism and health disparities within the medical community.
</p>
 
<p>
“This is so outside our box,” says Hanscom. “At the WSMA we have traditionally opposed mandating clinical education. How do you make sure the content, especially clinical content, you’re mandating is accurate? Medicine is ever evolving.
</p>
<p>
“But with this topic, the Legislature wouldn’t be mandating the content and it’s not clinical in nature,” she says. “I think it’s well recognized that we need to look deep in medicine’s history and develop content that addresses what has led to disparities in health care, particularly in the areas of race and culture. It’s a first step to overcoming larger societal issues. You have to start at home first.”
</p>
<p>
And while it might seem like improving cell phone and broadband access is off topic for WSMA’s advocacy efforts, telemedicine has made it important for the WSMA to join with other groups to support those efforts.
</p>
<p>
“With this new way of delivering care, we find it particularly beneficial to physicians to get to know patients in their own environment,” Hanscom says. “Imagine what you can pick up. You’re seeing things that might give you clues to why their chronic conditions aren’t well managed.”
</p>

<p>
In an example the WSMA used in a newspaper op-ed, a physician had a patient who was a cellist and was struggling with her wrists.
</p>
<p>
“She’ll never bring her cello into the clinic,” she says. “In telemedicine, the physician saw her play her cello. Seeing her movements helped the physician develop a course of treatment for her.”
</p>

<p>
Telemedicine visits delivered over the phone are also helping physicians connect with chronic disease patients who aren’t able to take time off from work for a clinic appointment. But they might take a break from work and talk to their doctor on the phone.
</p>
<p>
“That’s just better patient care,” Dr. Schlicher says.
</p>
<h3>New opportunities for physician advocacy</h3>
<p>
If there is a silver lining to the elimination of in-person lobbying in the Legislature this year, it's that it exponentially increases the opportunities for WSMA members to serve as advocates. Committee testimony won’t be limited to individuals on the Capitol campus; anyone in the state could testify, Graham says.
</p>
<p>
“People in more rural areas that often feel left out have the same opportunity to participate,” he says. “Those are the areas often with the most dire need for access to care. They have unique needs in their areas; it’s a good opportunity to highlight those disparities.”
</p>
<p>
Plus, the WSMA has been a vital source of information for the state’s elected officials during the pandemic, making them aware of the issues facing physicians. Legislators already know what the medical community is facing and they’re willing to listen.
</p>
<p>
“No one will be surprised by what we have to say,” Hanscom says.
</p>
<p>
Even better, WSMA members can advocate from their own offices.
</p>
<p>
“We need people to send emails and letters and set up virtual meetings, which we’re all getting more familiar with,” Dr. Schlicher says. “It takes a little more planning, but it’s a lot easier on your schedule.”
</p>
<p>
With many of the traditional avenues for advocacy closed in terms of lobbyist access, it will be imperative that the physician community is fully engaged, he says. The 2021 Legislature is still going to be dealing with the pandemic and how to control it, and it’s vital that physicians are there to guide the discussions.
</p>
<p>
“Social determinants of health, access to education, food, internet—all those things impact the health of our community,” he says. “All those issues need our voice.”
</p>
<p>
In addition to the issues affecting patients, Dr. Schlicher notes, the WSMA needs members to remind legislators that the same physicians risking their lives on the front lines of the pandemic are struggling financially. They need and deserve help to be able to keep their doors open and keep serving their patients.
</p>
<p>
“If we’re not involved and we’re not at the table, then we’re on the menu; the Legislature will look at us as a source of revenue,” he says. “Practices are facing significantly higher costs, fewer patients, and impending CMS cuts. Small practices risking their lives shouldn’t be the source of revenue for the budget.”
