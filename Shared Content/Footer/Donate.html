    <h2>WSMA Foundation:&nbsp;Creating a Healthier Washington</h2>
    <p>
      The WSMA Foundation is living out a vision to make Washington the best
      place to receive care and to practice medicine.
    </p>
    <!-- FIX: Add image width and height -->

        alt="WSMA Foundation logo"

      />
    </div>
    <p>
      Patients want sound, compassionate advice from their doctor, whom they
      trust has their best interests at heart. And you want time to engage with
      your patient about their care decisions, their health and their
      well-being.
    </p>
    <p>
      The relationship between patient and doctor has been at the heart of good
      medicine for centuries. But in today’s era of “disruptions,” patients
      aren’t the only ones who are overwhelmed with intrusive new gadgets,
      confusing new policies and never-ending paperwork. Physicians are too. And
      these challenges can diminish the bond between doctor and patient.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      We know healthier doctors mean healthier patients. That’s why the WSMA
      Foundation for Health Care Improvement is working to restore and
      strengthen that critical bond by:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Giving patients and physicians tools to encourage conversations on
        treatments, options and shared decision-making.
      </li>
      <li>
        Working to reduce physician burnout and reconnecting physicians with the
        joy of practicing medicine.&nbsp;
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The Foundation is working with partners to develop and implement ambitious
      programs that touch and improve the lives of patients and health care
      providers in Washington state, including Honoring Choices® Pacific
      Northwest; Choosing Wisely®; Healthy Doctors, Healthier Patients; and The
      Medical Officer Collaborative.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      But more needs to be done. Your support today will help create a healthier
      Washington—providing better outcomes for physicians and their patients.
      Help further this work by making a tax-deductible donation today.

      WAMPAC: Working to Support and Elect Pro-medicine Candidates Washington
      State
    </h2>
    <p>Not interested in politics? You’re not the only one.</p>
    <p>
      But the fact is that elected officials are interested in you and the way
      you practice medicine.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <div class="col-sm-4 col-xs-12 pull-right">
      <img
        src="/images/Logos/wampac_logo.png"
        alt="WAMPAC logo"

    <p>
      WAMPAC (Washington Medical Political Action Committee) is WSMA’s
      nonpartisan political action committee. As the WSMA’s campaign arm, WAMPAC
      works to support and elect pro-medicine candidates across Washington
      state.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      WAMPAC is successful—in the 2016 election cycle, more than 97 percent of
      the candidates supported by WAMPAC won their campaign for office. Each of
      those successful races represents a relationship WAMPAC built with a
      lawmaker who sets policies that directly impact your profession and
      practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      And while WAMPAC has grown, we continue to trail the campaign spending of
      dentists, nurses and trial attorneys. For WAMPAC to remain relevant, we
      need your support.
    </p>
    <p>
      Help us make WAMPAC the most effective and influential PAC in the state of
      Washington. Your contribution will allow WAMPAC to build a strong base for
      steady contributions to candidates who support WSMA’s agenda, ensuring you
      have a voice in the political process.
