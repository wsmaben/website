Online Reference Committees and Forum intro and body

<p>
<strong>WSMA's general discussion forum gives members an opportunity to discuss proposed policy ideas prior to submitting as a formal resolution. Members may also use the general forum to discuss general topics of interest.</strong>
</p>
<!-- ************************** iPart ****************************** -->
<!--HIDE<p><em>Note: The virtual reference committees are no longer accepting comments on the resolutions to be discussed at the 2018 WSMA Annual Meeting (however, resolutions and member testimony can still be viewed after logging in to the password-protected forums below). Members wishing to provide further testimony are invited to attend the reference committee meetings during the annual meeting starting at 10 a.m. this Saturday (Oct. 13) at the Historic Davenport Hotel (in Pennington B). </em></p>-->
<!--HIDE<p>Virtual reference committees are grouped by topic. Once in the virtual reference committee, a brief summary of each item is listed so you can quickly review the items under consideration. Once you select an item, you can download the resolution for review and use the commenting function to leave input. You can also subscribe to an item being discussed and receive email alerts when others have posted replies to that topic.</p>-->
<h2>About the general discussion forum</h2>
<p>Access the members-only general discussion forum below. Use the general discussion forum to develop your policy idea before you submit your resolution for consideration by the House of Delegates. Tapping the expertise of your colleagues can help you hone your proposal and increase its chances for adoption. You can also use the general discussion forum to start discussions that don’t directly relate to a resolution. </p>
<!--HIDE<p>WSMA’s general discussion forum is password protected (you will be prompted for your password to enter). Discussions are organized by topic. You can create a new topic for discussion or reply to a topic already posted. You can also subscribe to a topic being discussed, to receive email alerts when others have posted replies to that topic.</p>-->
<h2>Forum rules</h2>
<p>As these online forums are for members only, you will be prompted to sign in to enter the forum. When you post a topic or a reply, your name will appear with your post or reply. If you are speaking on behalf of an organization, please include that information in your post/reply.</p>
<p>The WSMA encourages lively debate, but please behave courteously and responsibly. Comments that include profanity, personal attacks or inappropriate, offensive or illegal material will be removed.</p>
