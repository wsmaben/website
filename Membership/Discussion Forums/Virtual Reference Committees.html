<h1 class="mobileShow">Virtual Reference Committees</h1>
<p>
<strong>The WSMA's virtual reference committees give members an opportunity to review and provide feedback on official proposed WSMA policy.</strong>
</p>
<h2>About the virtual reference committees</h2>
<p>Access the members-only virtual reference committees below. Use the virtual reference committees to review and discuss resolutions and other business that will be considered by the House of Delegates during the WSMA Annual Meeting in the fall (comments in these virtual reference committees are compiled and considered by the members of the reference committees when making their recommendations to the House during the annual meeting).</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Materials posted on the WSMA Virtual
Reference Committees are items to be considered by the House of Delegates. No
action has been taken on any of these items. Resolutions are submitted by WSMA delegates/delegations, the WSMA Board of Trustees, and WSMA sections and are informational only. The statements and opinions expressed in resolutions are those of the authors and the WSMA makes no representations of any kind about the accuracy of information contained therein. Only those items that have been acted upon by the House can be considered official.</p>
<h2>Submitting a resolution</h2>
<p>To submit a resolution to be considered by the House of Delegates during the WSMA Annual Meeting, you must <a href="[@]WSMA/Events/Annual_Meeting/How_to_Write_a_Resolution/How_to_Write_a_Resolution.aspx">organize your proposal into the required resolution format and identify a sponsor</a> (resolutions must be sponsored by a WSMA delegate, alternate delegate or member of the board of trustees). Resolutions can be submitted to <a href="mailto:hod@wsma.org">hod@wsma.org</a> at any time during the year.</p>
<p>Once accepted, the WSMA will assign your resolution to a reference committee and then upload the resolutions into the corresponding virtual reference committee for discussion by members before going to the WSMA House of Delegates for action.</p>
<h2>Forum rules</h2>
<p>As these online forums are for members only, you will be prompted to sign in to enter the forum. When you post a topic or a reply, your name will appear with your post or reply. If you are speaking on behalf of an organization, please include that information in your post/reply.</p>
<p>The WSMA encourages lively debate, but please behave courteously and responsibly. Comments that include profanity, personal attacks or inappropriate, offensive or illegal material will be removed.</p>
<p>
By using the WSMA's websites and discussion forums, you agree to comply and be bound by the terms of use and related policies, which you find on our <a href="[@]Shared_Content/Footer/Privacy_and_Policies.aspx">Privacy and Policies page</a>.
