<strong>WSMA dues are paid on an annual basis.&nbsp;Dues are non-refundable and apply to a single year of membership.&nbsp;Membership extends from Jan. 1 through Dec. 31.&nbsp;</strong><br />
<br />
Most WSMA members who are insured by <a href="https://www.phyins.com/">Physicians Insurance</a> receive a discount of $300 on their liability insurance premium. Call Physicians Insurance at 206.343.7300 for details.</p>
<p>WSMA dues include a $25 contribution for the <a href="[@]WSMA/Advocacy/WAMPAC/WAMPAC.aspx">Washington Medical Political Action Committee (WAMPAC)</a>  or the <a href="[@]WSMA/About/WSMA_Foundation/WSMA_Foundation.aspx">WSMA Foundation for Health Care Improvement</a> , a not-for-profit 501(c)(3) corporation which supports improvements in the quality and delivery of health care services for all Washingtonians. When paying your dues, please select WAMPAC or WSMA Foundation to indicate where you'd like your contribution directed. Should you allocate $25 to the WSMA Foundation, it is 100% tax deductible.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong>&nbsp;In most cases, a portion of the medical association dues may be deductible for tax purposes as professional or business expenses. The Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993 states that association dues used for lobbying activities are not deductible as a business expense. As a result, a portion of your WSMA dues cannot be deducted as a business expense for federal income tax purposes. See below for current non-deductible lobbying percentage rates. No portion of any dues paid to WAMPAC can be deducted as a business expense on your federal income tax return.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>2019 non-deductible lobbying percentage rate is 12%.<br />
2018 non-deductible lobbying percentage rate is 15%.<br />
2017&nbsp;non-deductible lobbying percentage rate is 20%.</strong></p>
