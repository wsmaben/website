<p>
<strong>The WSMA offers advance directives&mdash;both the health care directive and the durable power of attorney for health care&mdash;to physicians and patients to help guide decision-making at the end of life.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>NEW: House Bill 1175, passed during the 2019 Washington State Legislative Session and effective July 28, 2019, expands decision-making options for patients who lack capacity and updates the health care directive (living will) to include an option for a notary. Learn more in the FAQ section below.</em>

<p>
The term 'advance directive' refers to your oral and written instructions about your future medical care in the event you are unable to express your medical wishes.
</p>
<p>
It is important to let your physician and loved ones know your wishes for treatment should you ever be unable to express them yourself. Most health facilities assume you want all available medical treatment, including life-sustaining care, unless you direct otherwise. Advance directives can help direct these decisions. WSMA provides two strong options for patients to document their wishes&mdash;first, our new Honoring Choies Pacific Northwest advance directive and, second, our "Who Will Decide If You Can't" advance directive brochure. Each option contains the health care directive (a.k.a. living will) and the durable power of attorney for health care. Which option you choose is a matter of preference&mdash;both versions of an advance directive are considered legal documents under state and federal law.
