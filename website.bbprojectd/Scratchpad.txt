<h2>WSMA Praises Gov. Inslee's Ban on Non-Essential Business and Travel in Response to COVID-19</h2>
<p>
SEATTLE  -  The Washington State Medical Association, representing physicians and physician assistants across the state - many of whom are serving on the frontlines of the COVID-19 epidemic - is praising Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee for his order today mandating the closure of non-essential businesses and that Washington residents avoid any unnecessary travel. The policy strengthens the state's current COVID-10 emergency response by calling on all Washingtonians to stay at home except for "essential reasons," such as buying groceries or seeking medical care.

"We must do everything we can to support our frontline defense during this outbreak - the emergency responders, the physicians, physician assistants, nurses, our staff - to try and mitigate the outbreak," says William K. Hirota, president of the association. "The data and modeling are clear - we are facing a storm, and we must act now to minimize the damage. We thank the governor for taking this step and we join him in urging the public to listen."

Given the virus' contagiousness during a protracted incubation period - and dramatic undertesting, which has crippled public health's ability to trace and contain infections - experts agree that the next few weeks and months will see a steady rise of patients presenting at ICUs and EDs with severe COVID-19 illness. The influx of COVID-19 patients threatens to overwhelm Washington state's hospitals and emergency responders, which has led to increasingly stronger pronouncements by the governor and public health leaders urging Washingtonians to stay home and help to slow the virus' transmission.

"We recognize the once-in-a-lifetime challenge this is for everybody, health care workers and public alike," added Dr. Hirota. "And we know there will be economic fallout for all of society, including for some of our physician practices. Part of this enormous challenge ahead will be keeping our economy running and helping businesses - including medical clinics - survive this outbreak.

Washington state also faces a severe shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) - critical protection for emergency care and frontline health care personnel during the pandemic, and also for physician practices and clinics throughout the state, whose ability to screen and treat potential COVID-19 patients will be crucial in alleviating pressure on our state's hospitals.

"This really is a perfect storm - we're facing a shortage of PPE, testing, ventilators in ICUs to help with respiratory illness, even health care workers, as more of our colleagues fall ill or test positive," says Nathan Schlicher, MD, JD, 1st vice president at the association and an emergency room physician with Team Health/CHI Franciscan. "It's radically impacting health care and it's radically impacting the lives of our patients, who are facing major disruption in their lives. We are truly all in this together. The governor's announcement today was the right step - and we're looking forward to working with him and our public health leaders on the next steps: getting PPE out to our clinics, more testing, and strategies to address the financial impact, just to name a few."
