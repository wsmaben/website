<h3>A message from your president</h3>
<div class="col-md-2 pull-left" style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Bill Hirota, MD" src="/images/HeadShots/Bill-Hirota-Circle-Portrait-125x125px.png" class="pull-left" /></div>
<p>
Dear Colleagues,
</p>
<p>
While the 2020 WSMA Annual Meeting is still many months away, the WSMA board of trustees has made the important decision to transition the live meeting in Spokane to a virtual one day House of Delegates meeting on Saturday, Sept. 26. This decision was based on our overwhelming concern for the safety and well-being of our members, their patients, exhibitors, staff and the families of all involved.
</p>
<p>
The meeting will be condensed to focus only on the business of the House of Delegates. In the weeks preceding the meeting, we will open our <a href="[@]WSMA/Membership/Discussion_Forums/Virtual_Reference_Committees/WSMA/Membership/Discussion_Forums/virtual_reference_committees.aspx?hkey=d674a5ae-4fb5-48d6-b969-16aab9b63647">virtual reference committee forums</a> to give all members the opportunity to provide feedback on resolutions coming before the House. In addition to the online forums, we will also hold virtual reference committee meetings in advance of the meeting to give members an opportunity to provide live testimony. On Sept. 26, the House will act on the reference committee reports, vote on the slate of candidates for the board of trustees, and conduct other business of the House.
</p>
<p>
Your speaker, vice speaker, and WSMA staff are currently working on the new schedule and will share that information shortly.
</p>
<p>
Although we will miss the opportunity to see each other face to face in Spokane this fall, we look forward to delivering an efficient House of Delegates experience. Thank you for all that you do for the WSMA and, most importantly, for those we serve: our patients. You have my deepest appreciation. I look forward to seeing you virtually in September! Stay safe and be well.
</p>
<p>
Best regards,<br />
Bill Hirota, MD<br />
WSMA President

<p>The Annual Meeting of the WSMA House of Delegates (or the WSMA Annual Meeting) is the WSMA's premiere policy-making event, when the approximately 200 voting members of the WSMA House of Delegates gather to debate and determine policy for the association, elect officers and network with colleagues. All are welcome to attend the WSMA Annual Meeting and take advantage of the educational offerings, network and learn more about the association.</p>
<p>All legislative power of the WSMA—including the power to alter, amend or repeal the bylaws—is vested in the House of Delegates. All business of the House is conducted according to parliamentary procedures as outlined in “The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure.” The speaker of the House serves as parliamentarian. The speaker of the House is Matthew Grierson, MD, of Seattle. The vice speaker of the House is Ray Hsiao, MD, of Seattle.</p>
<p>Policymaking at the meeting is primarily driven by resolutions. A resolution is a proposal asking the WSMA to take a position or act on an issue. <a href="[@]WSMA/Events/Annual_Meeting/How_to_Write_a_Resolution/How_to_Write_a_Resolution.aspx">Learn more about resolutions and how they help create and guide WSMA policy</a>.</p>
<h3>How the House of Delegates operates</h3>
<p>The House convenes its opening session on Saturday morning of the WSMA Annual Meeting. At this time, guests are invited to speak to the delegates and all reports and resolutions are referred to reference committees. This is followed by meetings of the reference committees on Saturday.</p>
<p>The House holds a second session on Sunday morning. The reference committees present their reports for consideration by the House on Sunday.</p>

<p><a href="javascript://[Uploaded files/Events/Annual Meeting/WSMA_2019_DelDuties-Update.pdf]">Learn more about delegate duties</a> .</p>
<h3>Reference committees</h3>
<p>The in-person reference committees scheduled at the WSMA Annual Meeting are the key to the deliberations of the House of Delegates. Members of the House and individual members of the WSMA are invited and encouraged to attend these meetings to discuss and debate reports and resolutions due to be considered by the House for action.</p>
<p>Each reference committee is made of three members of the House appointed by the speaker and vice speaker.</p>
<p>The chair of the reference committee has the prerogative to permit non-members of the WSMA to present testimony. Committee meetings are open to the press.</p>
<p>When offering testimony before the reference committee, or on the floor of the House, please identify yourself and the society or organization which you represent. It is helpful, unless raising a point of order or asking a question, if you indicate you are speaking in favor of, or in opposition to, the resolution or report under discussion.</p>
<p>Remember, the reference committee is the most appropriate place for you to express your opinions and those of your constituents. Discussion on the floor of the House on Sunday is generally in response to the recommendations made by the reference committee and is not intended as a replay of more extensive testimony given at the committee hearings.</p>
<p>Most reference committees complete their business in two to three hours on Saturday. The committee reports are published under the direction of the speaker and vice speaker and are available on the WSMA website by Saturday evening and in hard copy by 7 a.m. on Sunday.</p>
<h3>Virtual reference committees and general discussion forum</h3>
<p>The WSMA offers password-protected <a href="[@]WSMA/Membership/Discussion_Forums/Virtual_Reference_Committees/WSMA/Membership/Discussion_Forums/virtual_reference_committees.aspx?hkey=d674a5ae-4fb5-48d6-b969-16aab9b63647">virtual reference committees</a> for those members who aren't able to attend the in-person reference committees, or who wish to review and discuss resolutions prior to the WSMA Annual Meeting. The WSMA also offers a <a href="[@]WSMA/Membership/Discussion_Forums/General_Discussion_Forum/WSMA/Membership/Discussion_Forums/general_discussion_forum.aspx?hkey=904922a3-1548-46a9-8634-44aa41a0d45d">general discussion forum</a>, also available year-round, for members to develop their policy ideas or start a discussion on any general topic.</p>
