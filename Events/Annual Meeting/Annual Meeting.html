<p>
Dear Colleagues,
</p>
<p>
The WSMA board of trustees has made the important decision to transition our usual annual in-person House of Delegates meeting to a virtual setting: virtual reference committee hearings will be held on Saturday, Sept. 26, followed by a virtual House of Delegates meeting on Sunday, Sept. 27. This decision was based on our overwhelming concern for the safety and well-being of our members, their patients, exhibitors, staff, and the families of all involved.
</p>
<p>
In the weeks preceding the meeting, we will open our <a href="[@]WSMA/Membership/Discussion_Forums/Virtual_Reference_Committees/WSMA/Membership/Discussion_Forums/virtual_reference_committees.aspx?hkey=d674a5ae-4fb5-48d6-b969-16aab9b63647">virtual reference committee forums</a> to give WSMA members an opportunity to review and provide feedback on the resolutions that will be considered by the House. Then, on Sept. 26, we will hold "live" virtual reference committee meetings via Zoom, an opportunity for members to provide verbal testimony to reference committee members. Then, on Sept. 27 via Zoom, the House will act on the reports of the reference committees, vote on the slate of candidates for the board of trustees, and conduct other business of the House.
</p>
<p>
Although we will miss the opportunity to see each other face to face in Spokane this fall, we look forward to delivering an efficient House of Delegates experience. Thank you for all that you do for the WSMA and, most importantly, for those we serve: our patients. You have my deepest appreciation. I look forward to seeing you virtually in September! Stay safe and be well.
</p>
<p>
Best regards,<br />
Bill Hirota, MD<br />
WSMA President

<p>
Dear members of the WSMA House of Delegates,
</p>
<p>
As you likely know by now, the WSMA board of trustees made the decision to transition the WSMA Annual Meeting of the House of Delegates to a fully virtual meeting to occur on the previously scheduled dates of Sept. 26-27. We have condensed the meeting to focus on House of Delegates business only, including virtual Reference Committees (both online in advance of the meeting and live virtual hearings on Sept. 26), voting on new board of trustees members, and inaugurating the incoming WSMA president. Your speakers and staff are working to design a meeting that will still allow for robust policy debate, including offering a secure voting platform for delegates, using a virtual format. We appreciate your patience as we work through the details and will continue to provide updates and information about how to access the meeting as the date approaches.
</p>
<h3>Resolutions</h3>
<p>
Please note the final deadline for resolutions is Aug. 27. Resolutions received after this date require two-thirds consent of the House at the opening session in order to be considered. Additional information about <a href="[@]WSMA/Events/Annual_Meeting/How_to_Write_a_Resolution/WSMA/Events/Annual_Meeting/How_to_Write_a_Resolution/How_to_Write_a_Resolution.aspx?hkey=a22cd977-aaed-4445-9ee2-6fc4716a7136&amp;_zs=j2aFd1&amp;_zl=nXaw6">how to draft and submit resolutions</a> can be found on the WSMA website.
</p>
<h3>Reference committees</h3>
<p>
We are currently seeking volunteers interested in serving on a reference committee at this year's virtual meeting. Reference committee service is vital to the smooth operation of the House and is a great way to gain leadership experience while serving our House of Delegates. Reference committee members must commit to attending both Saturday and Sunday sessions (Sept. 26 and 27) and to being available on Saturday afternoon/evening to meet in a virtual executive session to draft the committee's report to the House.
</p>
<h3>Delegate Handbook</h3>
<p>
The Delegate Handbook will be available as a downloadable PDF on the <a href="[@]WSMA/Events/Annual_Meeting/WSMA/Events/Annual_Meeting/Annual_Meeting.aspx?hkey=fea49254-3815-4dc9-8710-53ff2e3a100f">Annual Meeting page</a> of the WSMA website beginning on Aug. 21.
</p>
<h3>Special guest: AMA president</h3>
<p>
We have been fortunate to have the American Medical Association president join us at our Annual Meeting for the past couple years, and this year is no exception. We are pleased to announce AMA President Susan Bailey, MD, will be speaking at our virtual opening session on Saturday, Sept. 26. We will conclude Dr. Bailey's talk with time for Q&amp;A.
</p>
<h3>More information coming soon</h3>
<p>
We will continue to provide regular updates as the meeting approaches. In the meantime, please make sure you have the dates on your calendar, and we look forward to seeing you all online on Sept. 26.
</p>
<p>
Sincerely,
</p>
<p>
Matthew Grierson, MD, Speaker<br />
Ray Hsiao, MD, Vice Speaker<br />

<p>
<em>Note: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the WSMA will hold the 2020 Annual Meeting of the WSMA House of Delegates virtually. On Sept. 26, we will hold reference committee hearings via Zoom, and on Sept. 27, the House will meet via Zoom to conduct the business of the House. The operations of the reference committee hearings and House of Delegate meetings will still follow the general structure as outlined below.</em>
</p>
<p>The Annual Meeting of the WSMA House of Delegates (or the WSMA Annual Meeting) is the WSMA's premiere policy-making event, when the approximately 200 voting members of the WSMA House of Delegates gather to debate and determine policy for the association, elect officers and network with colleagues. All are welcome to attend the WSMA Annual Meeting and take advantage of the educational offerings, network and learn more about the association. </p>
<p>All legislative power of the WSMA—including the power to alter, amend or repeal the bylaws—is vested in the House of Delegates. All business of the House is conducted according to parliamentary procedures as outlined in “The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure.” The speaker of the House serves as parliamentarian. The speaker of the House is Matthew Grierson, MD, of Seattle. The vice speaker of the House is Ray Hsiao, MD, of Seattle.</p>
<p>Policymaking at the meeting is primarily driven by resolutions. A resolution is a proposal asking the WSMA to take a position or act on an issue. <a href="[@]WSMA/Events/Annual_Meeting/How_to_Write_a_Resolution/How_to_Write_a_Resolution.aspx">Learn more about resolutions and how they help create and guide WSMA policy</a>.</p>
<h3>How the House of Delegates operates</h3>
<p>The House convenes its opening session on Saturday morning of the WSMA Annual Meeting. At this time, guests are invited to speak to the delegates and all reports and resolutions are referred to reference committees. This is followed by meetings of the reference committees on Saturday.</p>
<p>The House holds a second session on Sunday morning. The reference committees present their reports for consideration by the House on Sunday.</p>
<p><a href="[@]WSMA/About/Leadership/House_of_Delegates/House_of_Delegates.aspx">Learn more about the House of Delegates</a>.</p>
<p><a href="javascript://[Uploaded files/Events/Annual Meeting/WSMA_2020_DelDuties.pdf]">Learn more about delegate duties</a>.</p>
<h3>Reference committees</h3>
<p>The in-person reference committees scheduled at the WSMA Annual Meeting are the key to the deliberations of the House of Delegates. Members of the House and individual members of the WSMA are invited and encouraged to attend these meetings to discuss and debate reports and resolutions due to be considered by the House for action.</p>
<p>Each reference committee is made of three members of the House appointed by the speaker and vice speaker.</p>
<p>The chair of the reference committee has the prerogative to permit non-members of the WSMA to present testimony. Committee meetings are open to the press.</p>
<p>When offering testimony before the reference committee, or on the floor of the House, please identify yourself and the society or organization which you represent. It is helpful, unless raising a point of order or asking a question, if you indicate you are speaking in favor of, or in opposition to, the resolution or report under discussion.</p>
<p>Remember, the reference committee is the most appropriate place for you to express your opinions and those of your constituents. Discussion on the floor of the House on Sunday is generally in response to the recommendations made by the reference committee and is not intended as a replay of more extensive testimony given at the committee hearings.</p>
<p>Most reference committees complete their business in two to three hours on Saturday. The committee reports are published under the direction of the speaker and vice speaker and are available on the WSMA website by Saturday evening and in hard copy by 7 a.m. on Sunday.</p>
<h3>Virtual reference committees and general discussion forum</h3>
<p>The WSMA offers password-protected <a href="[@]WSMA/Membership/Discussion_Forums/Virtual_Reference_Committees/WSMA/Membership/Discussion_Forums/virtual_reference_committees.aspx?hkey=d674a5ae-4fb5-48d6-b969-16aab9b63647">virtual reference committees</a> for those members who aren't able to attend the in-person reference committees, or who wish to review and discuss resolutions prior to the WSMA Annual Meeting. The WSMA also offers a <a href="[@]WSMA/Membership/Discussion_Forums/General_Discussion_Forum/WSMA/Membership/Discussion_Forums/general_discussion_forum.aspx?hkey=904922a3-1548-46a9-8634-44aa41a0d45d">general discussion forum</a>, also available year-round, for members to develop their policy ideas or start a discussion on any general topic.</p>
