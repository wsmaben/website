<h1>WSMA Annual Meeting</h1>
<p>
The 2020 WSMA Annual Meeting will take place online on Saturday, Sept. 26 and Sunday, Sept. 27.
</p>

<h3>Here’s how it will work</h3>

<p>
Both the Saturday and Sunday portions of the meeting will use two platforms – Zoom, to manage the audio/video components, and <a href="https://meet.wsma.org/">meet.wsma.org</a>, to manage the business of the House of Delegates.
</p>

<h3>Here’s how to join the meeting</h3>

<p>
<em>(Note: You will need to follow these exact steps in advance of the meeting. We advise that you prepare a day or more ahead of the meeting to give yourself time to learn how to navigate these platforms.)</em>
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Pre-register online for the 2020 Annual Meeting of the WSMA House of Delegates <a href="https://wsma.org/Shared_Content/Events/Event_Display.aspx?EventKey=ANNMTG2020">here</a>. You must take this step before proceeding further.</li>
	<li>After you pre-register for the meeting, watch your inbox for next steps. After a few hours, you will receive an email from HOD Help (<a href="mailto:hodhelp@wsma.org">hodhelp@wsma.org</a>) with instructions to activate your account on <a href="https://meet.wsma.org/">meet.wsma.org</a>. If you don’t see the email, check your junk or spam folders.</li>
	<li>Login to your account on <a href="https://meet.wsma.org/">meet.wsma.org</a> and access the section <a href="https://meet.wsma.org/#/hub">InfoHub</a> to locate links to training and the meetings, and other useful information.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Other information:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>If you need help or cannot login to the meet.wsma platform, email <a href="mailto:hodhelp@wsma.org">hodhelp@wsma.org</a> (a phone number will be added during the meeting) or you can use the Help dropdown at <a href="http://meet.wsma.org">http://meet.wsma.org</a> (look in the upper right corner).</li>
	<li>Zoom meeting links will be found on the Info Hub at <a href="http://meet.wsma.org">http://meet.wsma.org</a>.</li>
	<li>Phone audio will be disabled for meeting. You will need to use the Zoom app on computer/phone with speakers and mic (if you want to speak) enabled.</li>
	<li>Two windows will be needed. Multiple monitors or multiple devices will work best – one for seeing and hearing in Zoom; one for following the House of Delegate business at <a href="http://meet.wsma.org">http://meet.wsma.org</a>. Another option is splitting your screen so both platforms show on one screen.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Dear Colleagues,
</p>
<p>
The WSMA board of trustees has made the important decision to transition our usual annual in-person House of Delegates meeting to a virtual setting: virtual reference committee hearings will be held on Saturday, Sept. 26, followed by a virtual House of Delegates meeting on Sunday, Sept. 27. This decision was based on our overwhelming concern for the safety and well-being of our members, their patients, exhibitors, staff, and the families of all involved.
</p>
<p>
In the weeks preceding the meeting, we will open our <a href="[@]WSMA/Membership/Discussion_Forums/Virtual_Reference_Committees/WSMA/Membership/Discussion_Forums/virtual_reference_committees.aspx?hkey=d674a5ae-4fb5-48d6-b969-16aab9b63647">virtual reference committee forums</a> to give WSMA members an opportunity to review and provide feedback on the resolutions that will be considered by the House. Then, on Sept. 26, we will hold "live" virtual reference committee meetings via Zoom, an opportunity for members to provide verbal testimony to reference committee members. Then, on Sept. 27 via Zoom, the House will act on the reports of the reference committees, vote on the slate of candidates for the board of trustees, and conduct other business of the House.
</p>
<p>
Although we will miss the opportunity to see each other face to face in Spokane this fall, we look forward to delivering an efficient House of Delegates experience. Thank you for all that you do for the WSMA and, most importantly, for those we serve: our patients. You have my deepest appreciation. I look forward to seeing you virtually in September! Stay safe and be well.
</p>
<p>
Best regards,<br />
Bill Hirota, MD<br />
WSMA President

It's imperative that all attendees <a href="[@]WSMA/Events/Annual_Meeting/WSMA/Events/Annual_Meeting/Annual_Meeting.aspx?hkey=fea49254-3815-4dc9-8710-53ff2e3a100f">register in advance</a> in order to get set up in PC-Biz prior to the meeting. Once you've registered for the meeting, watch your in box for a message from HOD Help (<a href="mailto:hodhelp@wsma.org">hodhelp@wsma.org</a>) which will contain a link to validate your account.

</p>
<h3>Delegate Training</h3>
<p>

<em>Note: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the WSMA will hold the 2020 Annual Meeting of the WSMA House of Delegates virtually. On Sept. 26, we will hold reference committee hearings via Zoom, and on Sept. 27, the House will meet via Zoom to conduct the business of the House. The operations of the reference committee hearings and House of Delegate meetings will still follow the general structure as outlined below.</em>
</p>
<p>The Annual Meeting of the WSMA House of Delegates (or the WSMA Annual Meeting) is the WSMA's premiere policy-making event, when the approximately 200 voting members of the WSMA House of Delegates gather to debate and determine policy for the association, elect officers and network with colleagues. All are welcome to attend the WSMA Annual Meeting and take advantage of the educational offerings, network and learn more about the association.</p>
<p>All legislative power of the WSMA&mdash;including the power to alter, amend or repeal the bylaws&mdash;is vested in the House of Delegates. All business of the House is conducted according to parliamentary procedures as outlined in "The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure." The speaker of the House serves as parliamentarian. The speaker of the House is Matthew Grierson, MD, of Seattle. The vice speaker of the House is Ray Hsiao, MD, of Seattle.</p>
<p>Policymaking at the meeting is primarily driven by resolutions. A resolution is a proposal asking the WSMA to take a position or act on an issue. <a href="[@]WSMA/Events/Annual_Meeting/How_to_Write_a_Resolution/How_to_Write_a_Resolution.aspx">Learn more about resolutions and how they help create and guide WSMA policy</a>.</p>
<h3>How the House of Delegates operates</h3>
<p>The House convenes its opening session on Saturday morning of the WSMA Annual Meeting. At this time, guests are invited to speak to the delegates and all reports and resolutions are referred to reference committees. This is followed by meetings of the reference committees on Saturday.</p>
<p>The House holds a second session on Sunday morning. The reference committees present their reports for consideration by the House on Sunday.</p>
<p><a href="[@]WSMA/About/Leadership/House_of_Delegates/House_of_Delegates.aspx">Learn more about the House of Delegates</a>.</p>
<p><a href="javascript://[Uploaded files/Events/Annual Meeting/WSMA_2020_DelDuties.pdf]">Learn more about delegate duties</a>.</p>
<h3>Reference committees</h3>
<p>The in-person reference committees scheduled at the WSMA Annual Meeting are the key to the deliberations of the House of Delegates. Members of the House and individual members of the WSMA are invited and encouraged to attend these meetings to discuss and debate reports and resolutions due to be considered by the House for action.</p>
<p>Each reference committee is made of three members of the House appointed by the speaker and vice speaker.</p>
<p>The chair of the reference committee has the prerogative to permit non-members of the WSMA to present testimony. Committee meetings are open to the press.</p>
<p>When offering testimony before the reference committee, or on the floor of the House, please identify yourself and the society or organization which you represent. It is helpful, unless raising a point of order or asking a question, if you indicate you are speaking in favor of, or in opposition to, the resolution or report under discussion.</p>
<p>Remember, the reference committee is the most appropriate place for you to express your opinions and those of your constituents. Discussion on the floor of the House on Sunday is generally in response to the recommendations made by the reference committee and is not intended as a replay of more extensive testimony given at the committee hearings.</p>
<p>Most reference committees complete their business in two to three hours on Saturday. The committee reports are published under the direction of the speaker and vice speaker and are available on the WSMA website by Saturday evening and in hard copy by 7 a.m. on Sunday.</p>
<h3>Virtual reference committees and general discussion forum</h3>
<p>The WSMA offers password-protected <a href="[@]WSMA/Membership/Discussion_Forums/Virtual_Reference_Committees/WSMA/Membership/Discussion_Forums/virtual_reference_committees.aspx?hkey=d674a5ae-4fb5-48d6-b969-16aab9b63647">virtual reference committees</a> for those members who aren't able to attend the in-person reference committees, or who wish to review and discuss resolutions prior to the WSMA Annual Meeting. The WSMA also offers a <a href="[@]WSMA/Membership/Discussion_Forums/General_Discussion_Forum/WSMA/Membership/Discussion_Forums/general_discussion_forum.aspx?hkey=904922a3-1548-46a9-8634-44aa41a0d45d">general discussion forum</a>, also available year-round, for members to develop their policy ideas or start a discussion on any general topic.</p>
