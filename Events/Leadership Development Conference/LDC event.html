<h1>WSMA Leadership Development Conference</h1>
<h2>Leading Change: Strategies to Reduce Burnout</h2>
<p>Data from a recent WSMA Foundation survey are painting a picture most physicians are familiar with&mdash;a house of medicine united in purpose but straining under the weight of professional overwhelm.</p>
<p>The picture is clear, and the WSMA is acting. At this year's Leadership Development Conference, May 15-16 at Campbell's Resort on Lake Chelan, we'll explore the changes needed at the organizational and leadership levels to create healthier, more fulfilled physicians.</p>
<p>
All physicians, by nature, are leaders&mdash;whether of an organization, a care team, or an episode of care&mdash;and all physicians can benefit from the singular focus of this year's conference, as we seek to harness physicians' natural disposition (expertise, experience, knowledge, and vision) to put interventions in place to reduce overwhelm and increase professional satisfaction.</p>
<p>This activity has been approved for <em>AMA PRA Category 1 Credit&trade;</em>.</p>

Dear Colleagues,
</p>
<div class="col-lg-4 col-xs-12 pull-right"><img alt="WSMA President Tom Schaaf MD" src="/images/HeadShots/Schaaf.Tom_WSMAPortraits_2017.10.021.jpg" /></div>
<p>
I hope you are planning to join me and your peers at the 2020 WSMA Leadership Development Conference May 15 and 16 at Campbell's Lake Chelan Resort. This event is one of the most popular WSMA gatherings, combining top-quality programming and speakers amid a spectacular resort setting.
</p>
<p>
No matter what your "official" role or where you are in your career journey, this leadership conference is for you. We are all leaders, regardless of title, hierarchy or work situation. Our very roles mandate that we contribute expertise, experience, knowledge, vision&mdash;and hopefully, wisdom&mdash;to our patients, teams and communities.
</p>
<p>
Physicians who are healthy and fulfilled are better partners with their patients. A recent statewide survey showed that 43 percent of physicians and advanced practitioners experience burnout. Transformational change is needed at all levels, especially at the organizational and leadership levels, in order to create health care settings in which physicians and patients thrive. It takes strong leadership to put interventions in place to reduce burnout and improve professional fulfillment. This year's conference will focus on the organizational and leadership strategies to create healthy work environments that allow physicians to do what they do best: care for their patients.
</p>
<p>
The physician perspective is powerful and grounded in what is best for patients. It's more important than ever that our voice is heard clearly and that we are influencing the future of health care and health care decisions.
</p>
<p>
I look forward to seeing you in Chelan!
</p>
<p>
Tom Schaaf, MD<br>
WSMA President
