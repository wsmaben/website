<h3>About the Continuing Professional Development Webinar Series</h3>
<p>
Continuing Professional Development is the process of lifelong learning in which physicians acquire&mdash;through formal and informal activities&mdash;the medical and non-medical competencies they need to improve their ability to practice medicine and provide effective patient care. Engaging in CPD is a professional obligation and also a prerequisite for enhancing the quality of health care. The WSMA hosts this CPD webinar series as part of our commitment to supporting physicians and PAs on their lifelong learning journey.
