<h2>About the Continuing Professional Development Webinar Series</h2>
<p>
Continuing Professional Development is the process of lifelong learning in which physicians acquire&mdash;through formal and informal activities&mdash;the medical and non-medical competencies they need to improve their ability to practice medicine and provide effective patient care. Engaging in CPD is a professional obligation and also a prerequisite for enhancing the quality of health care. The WSMA hosts this monthly CPD webinar series as part of our commitment to supporting physicians and PAs on their lifelong learning journey.
