<p>
The WSMA is hitting the road (virtually) for a special free event designed to give WSMA members an opportunity to hear from WSMA leaders and for WSMA leaders to hear from you. Members are welcome to join us as we offer an update on WSMA’s advocacy and policy work, with an emphasis on our work during the COVID-19 outbreak. We’ll want to hear from you too, so we’ll divide into virtual breakout rooms where you’ll have an opportunity to share your thoughts with staff and members of the executive committee about how we can amplify our work in representing the profession or improving patient care.
</p>
<p>
The event will be fun and interactive, and there will be prizes. Plus, the first 25 people to register will receive a “Road Trip Snack Box” shipped to their home just in time for the Virtual Road Trip. Our Zoom space will be limited, so sign up quickly when registration opens. If the Aug. 27 event becomes over-subscribed, stay tuned as we’ll add another date to the schedule if needed.
