<h1>Errors</h1>
<p>
The WSMA reiterates its longstanding supportive efforts to curtail the problems of drug errors. (Res A-12, A-00) As such, the WSMA encourages physicians to add a brief notation of "purpose" (i.e. symptom) on prescriptions, where appropriate, to avoid confusion on the part of either the pharmacist or the patient. The WSMA also encourages residency programs to use this technique for enhanced patient communication. In addition, the WSMA encourages all pharmacists to communicate knowledge about drug interactions, and other relevant drug information as warranted, with prescribing physicians. (Res B-1, A-95; Res B-6, A-98) (Reaffirmed A-17)
</p>

<p>
The WSMA supports clarity and legibility of all written physician communications, including prescriptions. (Res B-2, A-02) (Reaffirmed A-17)
</p>

<p>
The WSMA encourages the sole use of the metric system across the entire health care system to avoid medication errors. (Res B-4, A-18)
