<p>
The WSMA endorses the three central recommendations of the Drug Addiction Treatment Task Force's drug treatment plan: 1) drug addiction treatment should be available to every Washington resident who needs it; 2) drug treatment should be complemented by other needed treatment and assistance, including mental health treatment; and, 3) special efforts should be made to assure that drug treatment, including inpatient treatment, is promptly available to children who need it. (Res A-2, A-01) (Reaffirmed A-17)
