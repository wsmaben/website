<h1>Emergency Contraceptives</h1>

The WSMA supports allowing pharmacists in Washington to dispense emergency contraceptives directly to patients under a prescriptive protocol, with a local physician advisor. The WSMA believes these pharmacist-physician alliances should be overseen by both the Washington State Pharmacy Quality Assurance Commission and the Washington Medical Commission.

The WSMA encourages physicians to educate patients about emergency contraception, in advance of the patient's stated need, whenever such education appears appropriate and feasible.
