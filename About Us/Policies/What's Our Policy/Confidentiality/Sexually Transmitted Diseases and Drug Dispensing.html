<h1>Sexually Transmitted Diseases and Drug Dispensing</h1>
<p>
The WSMA believes that a physician is not precluded from dispensing appropriate medication to a patient who has been diagnosed as having a sexually transmitted disease, such as gonorrhea, since forcing a patient to have such a drug dispensed in the presence of pharmacists could very well destroy the confidential nature of that particular patient-physician relationship. (JC 5.11-87) (Amended A-17)
