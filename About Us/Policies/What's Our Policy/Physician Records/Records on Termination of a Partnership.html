<h1>Records on Termination of a Partnership</h1>
<p>
The WSMA believes that when two or more physicians, who are partners in the practice of medicine, terminate the relationship, any question regarding the possession of the patients' clinical records should be determined on the basis of what is best for each patient, consistent with any contractual arrangements that may have been made. (JC 7.05-87) (Reaffirmed A-17)
