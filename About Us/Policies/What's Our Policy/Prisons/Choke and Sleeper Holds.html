<h1>Choke and Sleeper Holds</h1>
<p>
The WSMA does not regard the choke and sleeper holds as casually applied and easily reversible tranquilizers, but should be considered the use of deadly force with the potential to kill.
</p>

<p>
The WSMA believes that with, or as soon as thereafter as possible, all incidents involving the application of choke and sleeper holds there should be medical surveillance of the inmate. (Res 4, B-83) (Reaffirmed A-17)
