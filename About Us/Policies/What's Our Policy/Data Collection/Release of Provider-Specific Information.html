<h1>Release of Provider-Specific Information</h1>
<p>
WSMA policy states that the methods for collecting and analyzing provider-specific health care data must adhere to the following principles:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>The methods for collecting and analyzing provider-specific health care data shall be disclosed to providers under review and to the public.</li>

	<li>Providers under review and relevant provider organizations shall be provided with an adequate opportunity to review and respond to proposed provider-specific health care data interpretations and disclosures prior to their publication or release.</li>

	<li>Provider-specific health care data shall be valid, accurate, objective, and used primarily for the education of consumers and providers.</li>

	<li>Provider-specific health care data elements, including severity adjustment factors, shall be determined by a process which includes actively practicing providers knowledgeable in data definition, severity adjustment and regional variation.</li>

	<li>Statistically valid data collection, analysis, and reporting methodologies, including establishment of a statistically significant minimum number of cases, shall be developed and appropriately implemented prior to the release of provider-specific health care data.</li>

	<li>Reliable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to prevent the unauthorized use or disclosure of provider-specific health care data shall be developed. Such safeguards shall treat all underlying non-public provider-specific health care data and all analyses, proceedings, records, and minutes from quality review activities on provider-specific health care data as confidential. Provisions shall be made that none of these documents be subject to discovery, or admitted into evidence in any judicial or administrative proceeding.</li>

	<li>The quality and accuracy of the provider-specific health care data shall be routinely evaluated by a means such as conducting periodic medical records audits.</li>

	<li>That the WSMA recognizes that the Federal Institutional Review Board (IRB) process provides an appropriate mechanism to ensure confidentiality of clinical information and controls its dissemination.  </li>
</ol>
