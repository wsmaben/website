<h1>Testing of Neonates</h1>
<p>
The WSMA supports working with the Department of Health to adopt a policy encouraging anonymous testing of either all or random samples of blood, urine or other body fluids of neonates to identify frequency rates of the presence of addictive drugs and/or the HIV virus. The WSMA supports the initiation of such pilot projects. (Res 8, A-91; Res 2, A-90) (Reaffirmed A-17)
