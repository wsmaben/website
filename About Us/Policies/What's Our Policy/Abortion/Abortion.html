			Abortion
		</h1>
		<p>
			The WSMA affirms a woman's right to an abortion as a medical decision to be made under the advice and guidance of her physician in an accredited hospital or at a licensed medical facility. The WSMA opposes any attempt to restrict the availability of all reproductive health care, including abortion, through means such as the passage of financial limitations for government funded abortions; restrictive marital or parental consent limitations; public harassment of medical facilities, personnel or patients; or intrusion into the physician-patient relationship through increasingly stringent informed consent laws. (Res 22, C-84; Res 40, C-89) (Reaffirmed A-2017)

			The WSMA reaffirms its support of the right of physicians to include pregnancy termination as a part of their practice. (Res A-3, A-93) (Reaffirmed A-2017)
