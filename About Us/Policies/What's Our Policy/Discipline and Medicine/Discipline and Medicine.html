<h1>Discipline and Medicine</h1>
<p>
The WSMA believes a physician should expose, without fear or favor, incompetent, corrupt, dishonest, or unethical conduct on the part of members of the profession. The WSMA strongly believes that an ethical physician will observe the laws regulating the practice of medicine and will not assist others to evade such laws. (JC 9.04-87; Res 8, B-85) (Reaffirmed A-17)
