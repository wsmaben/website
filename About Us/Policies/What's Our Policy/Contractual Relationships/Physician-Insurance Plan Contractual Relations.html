<h1>Physician-Insurance Plan Contractual Relations</h1>
<p>
The WSMA reaffirms its position that health insurance company contracts shall not intrude upon the essential elements of the patient-physician relationship. Physician gag clauses, Wickline clauses, and health insurance companies' claims to being "sole definers of medical necessity" are antithetical to quality patient care. (Info Rpt 9, A-98) (Reaffirmed A-17)
