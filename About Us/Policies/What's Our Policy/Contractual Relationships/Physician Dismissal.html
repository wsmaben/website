<h1>Physician Dismissal</h1>
<p>
The WSMA has taken a position against the institution of physician dismissal from an insurance plan contract unless a cause is identified to the party so affected. The WSMA supports legislative action with the intent of prohibiting the insertion of such provisions in contracts for service between physicians and third-party carriers. (Res B-3, A-97) (Reaffirmed A-17)
