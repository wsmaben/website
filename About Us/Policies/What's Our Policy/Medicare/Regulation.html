<h1>Regulation</h1>
<p>
The WSMA is resolved to work with the AMA and local Medicare carriers to implement Medicare rules and regulations in a fair and objective manner, not jeopardizing good patient care, or compromising the due process rights of physicians. (PA Rpt C, '89; Res C-7, A-16) (Reaffirmed A-17)
</p>
	
<p>
The WSMA supports working through the AMA and state congressional delegations to amend the Medicare laws and regulations so that Medicare would be required to use the same standards and apply the same penalties to all physicians, regardless of participation or non-participation status. (PA Rpt C, '89; Res C-7, A-16) (Reaffirmed A-17)
