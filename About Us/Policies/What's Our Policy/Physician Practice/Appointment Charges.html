<h1>Appointment Charges</h1>
<p>
The WSMA believes that a physician may charge a patient for a missed appointment or for one not canceled within 24 hours in advance if the patient is fully advised that the physician will make such a charge. The practice, however, should be resorted to infrequently and always with the utmost consideration for the patient and their circumstances. (JC 8.01-87) (Reaffirmed A-17)
