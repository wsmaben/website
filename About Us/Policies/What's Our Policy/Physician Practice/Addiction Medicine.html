<h1>Addiction Medicine</h1>
<p>
The WSMA recommends that medical treatment of psychoactive substance use disorders should be provided by physicians with training, experience, and competence in addiction medicine. Recognition of those who practice addiction medicine should not be limited to any particular one of the 24 specialties recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties or the specialties recognized by the American Osteopathic Association. (Res B-4, A-93) (Reaffirmed A-17)
</p>

<p>
The WSMA recognizes that addiction medicine specialists are the authority in the diagnosis and treatment of addictive disorders, and supports changes in state statutes to reflect this in-patient referral, management, and compensation. (Res A-2, A-09)
</p>

<p>
The WSMA supports changes in state and federal laws and regulations to reduce restrictions placed on office-based physicians which currently prevent them from providing treatment for opiate addicted patients. (Res C-7, A-95) (Reaffirmed A-17)
</p>

<p>
The WSMA encourages its members to take more active roles in providing drug addiction treatment to afflicted individuals and to work with the State Department of Health and the Washington Medical Commission as well as other state and federal agencies to further curtail the ever-increasing morbidity and mortality associated with the detrimental effects of the wide variety of addictive drugs (including alcohol) available to our citizens. (Res B-5, A-04) (Amended A-17)
