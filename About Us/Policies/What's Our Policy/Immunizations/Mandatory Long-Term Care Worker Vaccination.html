<h1>Mandatory Long-Term Care Worker Vaccination</h1>
<p>
The WSMA supports a mandatory annual influenza vaccination for every long-term care worker who has direct patient contact unless a medical contraindication or religious objection exists. (Res A-1, A-11)
</p>

<p>
The WSMA recommends that physicians and other practitioners encourage caregivers &ndash; both professional health care workers and family caregivers &ndash; to obtain these vaccinations. (Res A-1, A-11) 
</p>

<p>
The WSMA urges physicians treating patients in long-term care facilities to encourage those facilities to establish policies and procedures that minimize barriers to staff influenza vaccination. (Res A-1, A-11)
