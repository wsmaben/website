<h1>Pharmaceutical Coverage</h1>
<p>
The WSMA supports prescription drugs being covered benefits in all public and private programs. Pharmacy benefits should be added only after the delivery system has been financially stabilized. In public programs, coverage should be needs based. Coverage should be paid for from the general fund and should not be selectively funded on the back on any segment of the delivery systems. (EC 9/00) (Amended A-17)
