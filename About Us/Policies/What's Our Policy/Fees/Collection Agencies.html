<h1>Collection Agencies</h1>
<p>
The WSMA believes that in referring a delinquent account to a collection agency, the physician should first give due consideration to the patient's ability to pay the fee which is due. The physician should not utilize the services of a collection agency whose tactics and methods of collection might be unfair or abusive; nor should he/she enter into any arrangement under which he/she would lose complete control of the delinquent account or the method of its collection. (JC 6.15-87) (Reaffirmed A-17)
