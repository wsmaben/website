<h1>Planned Home Births</h1>
<p>
The WSMA recommends the following safeguards for planned home births: 1) only low risk patients should be approved for planned home births; and, 2) any practitioner who wishes to provide this service must agree to submit data to the department for each birth (possibly as a condition of reimbursement) to allow the performance of appropriate peer review of procedures and outcomes, similar to those practices which occur in a hospital or birth center environment.
