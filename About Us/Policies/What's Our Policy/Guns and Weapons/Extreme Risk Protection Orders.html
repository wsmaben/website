<h1>Extreme Risk Protection Orders</h1>
<p>
The WSMA supports the concept of Extreme Risk Protection Orders, which allow families and law enforcement to petition a court to temporarily suspend a person's access to firearms if there is documented evidence that an individual is threatening harm to themselves or others because of dangerous mental illness or at high risk of violent behavior. (Res C-6, A-16) (Reaffirmed A-19)
