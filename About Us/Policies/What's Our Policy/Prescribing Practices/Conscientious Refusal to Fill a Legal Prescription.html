<h1>Conscientious Refusal to Fill a Legal Prescription</h1>
<p>
The WSMA believes that individual pharmacists or pharmacy chains should be required to fill legally valid prescriptions, to contact the prescribing physician promptly for clarification, or to provide immediate referral to an appropriate alternative dispensing pharmacy without interference.  In the event that an individual pharmacist or pharmacy chain refers a patient to an alternative dispensing source, the individual pharmacist or the pharmacy chain is required to notify the prescribing physician of the referral.  (Res C-1, A-06)
