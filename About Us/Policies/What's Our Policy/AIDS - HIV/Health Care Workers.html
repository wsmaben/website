<h1>Health Care Workers</h1>
<p>
Employees of the health care system who might be at risk of contacts with infected blood or other body fluids must be afforded all available and practical protection to assure a low level of personal risk of occupational infection. Universal precautions and all other applicable infection control measures must be understood and consistently used to safeguard the health of all personnel. Physicians should be aware of the legal requirement to adhere to the OSHA regulations on bloodborne diseases. (EC Rpt H, A-92) (Amended A-17)
