<h1>Scope Of Practice - General</h1>

<p>
The WSMA opposes efforts for non-physician practitioners to expand the scope of their practice to include additional services currently performed by physicians, in the absence of either commensurate education and supervised training requirements, or a demonstrable and compelling societal need.  (Res 20, B-2019)
</p>


<p>
The WSMA opposes the adoption of any public policy by the Washington State Legislature or any regulatory agency which would encourage the delivery of health care services which are substantially outside of the recognized and accepted standards prevailing in the medical community. (Res 17, A 89) (Reaffirmed A-17)
</p>

<p>
The WSMA seeks to establish clearly defined scopes of practice for the various types of health care providers. The WSMA will actively work to achieve changes in public policy to see that those providers authorized to practice independently only deliver services clearly within the scopes of practice for the various disciplines. (Res 17, A-89; Res 43, B-88) (Reaffirmed A-17)
