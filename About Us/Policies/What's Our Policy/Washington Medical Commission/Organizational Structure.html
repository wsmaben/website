<h1>Organizational Structure</h1>
<p>
The WSMA supports legislation, rulemaking or administrative action that would result in a significant organizational change in the current WMC-DOH relationship: that administrative law judges be used to conduct hearings; that WMC have responsibility over investigators and attorneys working for it; and, that WMC retain all rule-making and policy-setting authority affecting the practice of medicine and WMC operations. (EC Rpt B, A-01) (Reaffirmed A-17)
