<h1>Professional Discrimination</h1>
<p>
The WSMA supports legislation prohibiting health maintenance organizations, professional service corporations, health care professions, clinics, individuals, insurance companies, and hospitals from discriminating against a qualified osteopathic physician and surgeon solely on the basis of his or her designation as an osteopathic physician and surgeon, providing clinical equivalency in his or her professional training. (Res C-9, A-94) (Reaffirmed A-17)
