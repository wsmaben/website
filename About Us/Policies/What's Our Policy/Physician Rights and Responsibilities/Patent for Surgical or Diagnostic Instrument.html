<h1>Patent for Surgical or Diagnostic Instrument</h1>
<p>
The WSMA believes that a physician may patent a surgical or diagnostic instrument he/she has discovered and developed. The laws governing patents are based on the sound doctrine that one is entitled to protect his/her discovery. (JC 9.08-87) (Reaffirmed A-17)
