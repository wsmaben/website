<h1>Due Process</h1>
<p>
The WSMA strongly believes the basic principles of a fair and objective hearing should always be accorded to the physician whose professional conduct is being reviewed. The fundamental aspects of a fair hearing are: a listing of specific charges, adequate notice of the right to a hearing, and the opportunity to present a defense. (JC 9.05-87) (Amended A-17)
