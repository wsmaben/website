<h1>Staff Privileges</h1>
<p>
The WSMA believes that physicians who are involved in the granting, denying, or termination of hospital privileges should be guided by concern for the welfare and best interests of patients in discharging this responsibility. The WSMA feels obtaining medical staff privileges is a privilege and not necessarily a right. The granting of medical staff privileges should be based on one's knowledge, training and other relevant factors. (JC 4.07-87) (Reaffirmed A-17)
