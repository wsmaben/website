<h1>Hospital Utilization Review</h1>
<p>
The WSMA does not support the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) utilization review regulations that attempt to take the review process out of the hands of physicians and to focus it on financial criteria and will work to modify any regulations with the above intent. (Res 29, C-84) (Amended A-17)
