<h1>Physician Relations</h1>
<p>
The WSMA supports the organizing of hospital medical staffs into physician corporations which access the expertise necessary to fully cooperate on a business-like basis with their hospitals on the DRG prospective payment system, and on a number of other cooperative arrangements and joint ventures in the interest of quality patient care and the preservation of their hospitals' economic viability necessary to their continuation as a valuable community resource. (EC Rpt D, C-83; Res 9, C-83; Res 12, C-83) (Reaffirmed A-17)

The WSMA opposes unfair and inappropriate hospital retaliation against physicians and also opposes the use of the term "disruptive physician" when physician behavior is appropriate according to the standard of the WSMA Model Medical Staff Bylaws. (Res B-5, A-12)
