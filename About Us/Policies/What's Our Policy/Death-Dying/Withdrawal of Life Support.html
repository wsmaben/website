<h1>Withdrawal of Life Support</h1>
<p>
The WSMA agrees that for humane reasons, with informed consent, a physician may do what is medically necessary to alleviate severe pain, or cease to omit treatment, including nutrition and hydration by other than natural methods, to let a terminally ill patient die, but he/she should not intentionally cause death. (JC 2.14-87) (Reaffirmed A-17)
