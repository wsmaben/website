<h1>School Based Health Care</h1>
<p>
The WSMA supports legislation that would create a state-funded program to enable local communities to provide health care service, referrals, or both, to school-aged teenagers in communities where a need is perceived and at locations where services will be utilized to most effectively provide health education and general health care. The WSMA believes such legislation should provide for maximum local control of such programs in a fashion consistent with local needs and shared values. (Res 1, A-87) (Reaffirmed A-17)
