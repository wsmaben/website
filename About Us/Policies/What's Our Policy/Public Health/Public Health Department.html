<h1>Public Health Department</h1>
<p>
The WSMA encourages county medical societies to help local health departments through activities such as testifying on budget issues, in order to obtain necessary personnel and funding to provide needed health care services. Additionally, the WSMA attempts to lobby at the state level for adequate funding of public health departments. (Res 32, A-90) (Reaffirmed A-17)
