The WSMA believes that it is unethical for a physician to prescribe, dispense, administer, or promote the use of any drug whose content or effect are unknown to him/her or to refuse to inform the patient (or his/her legal representative) about the identity and purpose of any drug which he/she has prescribed, dispensed, or administered to the public. (JC 2.17-87) (Reaffirmed A-17)
