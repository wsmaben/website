<h1>Fair and Equitable Taxation</h1>

<p>
The WSMA supports the concept of fair and equitable taxation in our state, including the implementation of a constitutionally limited income tax when used to reduce/eliminate/modify the sales tax and B & O tax as is otherwise appropriate and fair, and the WSMA resolved to participate in a coalition to this end. (Reaffirmed A-17) 
</p>

<p>
The WSMA supports taxation to achieve adequate financing of health and social programs. (Res 28, C-87; Res 9, C-88) (Reaffirmed A-17)
