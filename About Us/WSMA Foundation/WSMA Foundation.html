<h1>WSMA Foundation</h1>
<h2>Improving physician wellness and patient care</h2>
<p>
At the WSMA Foundation, we believe in a future where physicians are healthy and fulfilled; where physicians, the health care team, and patients are partners; and where all Washingtonians experience quality care that aligns with their needs, goals and values.</p>
<p>
Fulfilling that quest depends upon transformational change at all levels—individual, organizational and statewide. We believe that change is possible, and that physicians and patients can thrive in health care settings that support them.
</p>
<p>
The Foundation exists today because of the vision of forward-thinking doctors who cared about—and invested in—the future of the profession more than 50 years ago.
</p>
<p>
With your participation and support, the WSMA Foundation ensures that legacy will continue to benefit physicians today… and tomorrow.
</p>
<h2>A Matter of Numbers</h2>
<p>
Sometimes it probably feels like your days are consumed by numbers—patient data, insurance information, quality metrics, RVUs, and more—which contributes to the higher-than-average burnout rates among physicians and advanced practitioners in Washington. This video outlines the WSMA Foundation's work to address burnout and bring back the joy in your profession.</p>

<p>
Ours is a caring profession—it only makes sense to care for ourselves in order to ensure we are well enough to care for others.
</p>
<p>
We know that the external pressures heaped upon physicians by government, insurance companies, and regulatory entities steal time from patient care. We know that you're often told you are burned out ("it's your responsibility to fix it"), rather than leaders and systems acknowledging that they are overwhelming medical staff and employees ("it's our responsibility to fix it together").
</p>
<p>
And tragically, we know that more Washington physicians and advanced practitioners experience burnout than the national average.
</p>
<p>
We know that because of the results of our statewide 2018 Stanford Wellness Survey. This survey examined the culture of wellness, efficiency of practice, and personal resilience related to professional fulfillment. These results guide the development of a plan to identify and implement organization-level interventions that reduce burnout and improve wellness.
</p>
<p>
To that end, the WSMA Foundation is now moving beyond the burnout statistics, drivers, and implications, and is researching effective interventions to reduce burnout. This work—in partnership with the American Medical Association, The Physicians Foundation, C-suite executives, and wellness champions who can affect change—is now under way.
</p>
<p>
It's time to act. Our patients trust us to provide the best care that's right for them. Their lives—and ours—depend on it.

<p>
<a href="[@]WSMA/Resources/Advance_Care_Planning/Honoring_Choices_Pacific_Northwest/Honoring_Choices__Pacific_Northwest.aspx">Honoring Choices Pacific Northwest</a>, jointly sponsored by WSMA Foundation and WSHA, is an initiative to inspire conversations about the care people want at the end of life. The vision is that everyone will receive care that honors personal values and goals at the end of life.
</p>
<p>
This comprehensive enterprise uses a variety of approaches, including an advance care planning program, community engagement, physician and advanced practitioner education, advocacy, and development of a central repository. It also works at multiple levels to help the public make informed choices about end-of-life care and to train health care and community organizations on how to discuss, record, and honor people’s end-of-life choices.
</p>
<p>
When individuals talk about advance care planning, write it down, and share it around, they are much more likely to have their preferences followed.
</p>
<p>
Generous contributions from hospitals, health systems, medical groups, insurance companies, foundations, and individuals ensure everyone in our service area who want to participate can.

<p>
Physicians play a critical role in initiating conversations about appropriate care with patients and other clinicians. The <a href="[@]WSMA/Resources/Clinical_Quality/Choosing_Wisely/Choosing_Wisely.aspx">Choosing Wisely</a> ® effort helps them focus on doing the right thing for patients and avoiding unnecessary care that could harm them.
</p>
<p>
A national initiative of the American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation, Choosing Wisely enlisted over 70 medical specialty societies to identify overused tests and treatments. Their recommendations highlighted more than 400 medical tests, treatments, and procedures that clinicians and patients should discuss.
</p>
<p>
The WSMA Foundation raises awareness and equips physicians with tools to provide appropriate care in our state. The following key resources were created to help facilitate productive discussions between physicians and patients in choosing appropriate care:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="javascript://[Uploaded files/Resources/Clinical Quality/WSMA_ActionManual_online_FNL.pdf]">Action Manual</a>—step-by-step guide to reduce low-value care. </li>

<p>
The <a href="[@]WSMA/Resources/Physician_Leadership/Physician_Leadership.aspx">Medical Officer Collaborative</a> , jointly sponsored by WSMA and WSHA, provides a forum for senior physician leaders from medical groups, hospitals, and health systems across the state to collaborate on quality, patient safety, and leadership.
</p>
<p>
Chief medical officers, vice presidents of medical affairs, and medical staff presidents are uniquely positioned to create meaningful change within their organizations. This forum provides a safe place to openly discuss the challenges physicians face and outline effective solutions to those challenges.
</p>
<p>
The Collaborative has identified Choosing Wisely; Healthy Doctors, Healthier Patients; and Honoring Choices PNW as key priorities. They meet three times a year to share experiences and strategies to improve practices in these priority areas and others.
