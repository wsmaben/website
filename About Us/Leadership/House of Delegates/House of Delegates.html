<h2>
About the House of Delegates
</h2>
<p>
The WSMA House of Delegates is comprised of elected delegates from each county medical society, qualified state specialty societies and members of the <a href="[@]WSMA/About/Leadership/Board_of_Trustees/Board_of_Trustees.aspx">WSMA Board of Trustees</a>. There is one resident delegate, one student delegate and one young physician delegate. Each county society has one delegate for every 50 active WSMA members.
</p>
<p>
Each medical specialty society is entitled to elect or appoint one delegate and one alternate, provided that such specialty society has as members at least one hundred active members of the WSMA, or if the specialty society has fewer than 100 members, 50 percent of its members must belong to the WSMA.

WSMA governance outside of the annual House of Delegates meeting
</h2>
<p>
When the House of Delegates is not in session, the WSMA is governed by the <a href="[@]WSMA/About/Leadership/Board_of_Trustees/Board_of_Trustees.aspx">board of trustees</a>. The board meets quarterly, and is responsible for carrying out the mandates and policies of the House. The board has all the powers of the House except amending the bylaws or establishing dues or assessments.</p>
<p>
From the board of trustees, the WSMA president, president-elect, 1st vice president, 2nd vice president, immediate past president, secretary-treasurer and assistant secretary-treasurer form the <a href="[@]WSMA/About/Leadership/Executive_Committee/Executive_Committee.aspx">executive committee</a>. The committee meets monthly, and acts for the board in implementing WSMA programs and establishing interim policy.
</p>
<p>
The WSMA president is the spokesman for the association. The executive director/CEO is the chief executive officer.
