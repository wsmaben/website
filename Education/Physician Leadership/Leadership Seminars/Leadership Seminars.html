Join us May 7, 2021, 8-5pm

**This course is open to alumni and non-alumni of our courses. You must be in a physician leadership role at your organization.
</p>
<p>
Now more than ever, physicians are being asked to serve on the board of their clinic, medical group or integrated system. But in order to be an effective board member it is important to understand the difference between a constituency-based board and a representative board, what's expected of you in terms of fiduciary responsibility, who you are expected to represent and how to be effective in communicating as a board member. Equipped with this knowledge, physicians can be even stronger leaders, and bring a powerful voice and perspective to any board.
