<h1 class="mobileShow">Dyad Leadership Course</h1>
<p><strong>The WSMA Dyad Leadership Course is a three-day, in-person educational workshop for physicians and their administrative dyad partners who wish to improve team function and achieve greater operational success within their clinical system.</strong></p>
<p>Teamwork is necessary to achieve better outcomes. Having the whole team on the same page for the right reasons is crucial to drive real change. The WSMA Dyad Leadership Course is designed as a working “retreat” focusing on three aspects of leadership development:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Assessment of current individual, dyad, and team function, with attention to opportunities for improvement.</li>
    <li>Construction of a remediation process using classroom-based and health care facility-based resources to plan for individual, dyad, and team growth.</li>
    <li>An evaluation of progress toward goals at the completion of the course.</li>
</ul>
<p>This WSMA Dyad Leadership Course develops leadership knowledge and skills based on the ongoing operational needs of the physician and his/her administrative partner. The course is adapted to fit the specific clinical culture of participating teams. At the end of the course, participants will have a greater understanding of how to enhance leadership and operational success within their clinical system.</p>
