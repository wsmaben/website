<p>
We know that as physicians mature in their roles, they face increasingly complex problems. Early in their careers, physician medical directors rely on technical skills such as meeting management, basic finance, quality improvement, and tactical management skills that are helpful in running clinics. With experience, leaders recognize the problems they are trying to solve are complex, adaptive problems that involve personal style, group dynamics, and cultural components that resist easy solutions.
</p>
<p>
WSMA's new Problem-Solving Leadership Course examines the challenges physician leaders will encounter and provides the tools needed to solve those challenges. Designed to expand awareness of adaptive leadership solutions, the course is not a one-size-fits-all "fix." Rather, it provides an individualized framework building on each leader's style and gifts in order to help them achieve a delicate, but deliberate, management approach.
</p>
<p>
The course facilitates development of new, higher-level leadership skills by immersing participants in interactive problem-solving with peers facing similar situations. This learning experience equips developing leaders with self-knowledge about their reactive and creative problem-solving tendencies, while enabling them to test higher-order skill sets as they receive real-time feedback from peers.
</p>
<p>
At the end of this course, participants will be able to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Articulate the difference between technical and adaptive problems.</li>
    <li>Detail the results of a 360-degree Leadership Circle Profile, outlining their current problem-solving style.</li>
    <li>Articulate the use of Adaptive Leadership techniques based on the work of Ron Heifetz.</li>
    <li>Receive and give feedback on a range of complex, adaptive problems and formulate solutions.</li>
</ul>
