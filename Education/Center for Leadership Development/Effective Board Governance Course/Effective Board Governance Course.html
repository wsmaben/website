<h1 class="mobileShow">	Effective Board Governance Course</h1>
<p><strong>The WSMA Effective Board Governance Course is a half-day activity for WSMA members only, providing in-depth education about governance - what it is, what boards do, why they exist and how you can be an effective participant.</strong></p>
<h3>Why it's important</h3>
<p>Now more than ever, physicians are being asked to serve on the board of their clinic, medical group or integrated system. But in order to be an effective board member it's important to understand the difference between a constituency-based board and a representative board, what's expected of you in terms of fiduciary responsibility, who you are expected to represent and how to be effective in communicating as a board member. Equipped with this knowledge, physicians can be even stronger leaders, and bring a powerful voice and perspective to any board.</p>
<p>This activity has been approved for <em>AMA PRA Category 1 Credit™</em>. Details on CME credit are included in the curriculum information below.</p>
