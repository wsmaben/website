<h3> Engaging Patients: The ABIM Foundation Choosing Wisely&reg; Campaign</h3>
<p>
Evidence-based medicine is more than just using clinically-proven procedures; equally important is using the evidence to decide what <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> to do. Choosing Wisely&reg; is part of a multi-year effort by the ABIM Foundation, along with many national specialty society partners, to help physicians become better stewards of our limited health care resources. Twenty national organizations representing medical specialists, as well as Consumer Reports, have joined with the ABIM Foundation to help physicians, patients and other health care stakeholders think and talk about the overuse of health care resources. Each specialist organization has identified five tests or procedures commonly used in their field for which the necessity should usually be questioned and discussed. The resulting lists of <a href="http://choosingwisely.org/?page_id=13" target="_blank">"Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question"</a> are intended to spark discussion about the need, or lack thereof, for many frequently ordered tests or treatments. This webinar presents an overview of this campaign.</p>
<p>Presenters:<br />
Daniel Wolfson is Executive Vice President and COO of the ABIM Foundation, the national coordinator for the Choosing Wisely campaign. Karla Graue Pratt is Executive Vice President of the Washington Academy of Family Physicians. Susan Callahan is Director of Community Engagement for the Washington State Medical Association. John Gallagher is Director of Communications for the Puget Sound Health Alliance. All four presenters each have many years of experience in the effort to improve health care delivery, achieve better outcomes, and reduce health care costs.</p>

<h3>Medication Reconciliation Following Hospital Discharges</h3>
<p>Repeated studies have found medication errors following hospital discharge to be a serious problem. One in eight discharged patients has an adverse drug event within three weeks of discharge. Two-thirds of all medication errors occur during patient transitions, and over 1.5 million patients have a medication error annually, at a cost of $3.5 billion. An immediate need post discharge is medication reconciliation. This webinar, originally presented on October 3, 2012, presents why and how to efficiently perform medication reconciliation in primary care settings following a hospital discharge.</p>
<p>Presenters<br />
Jenny Arnold, PharmD, BCPS, is the director of pharmacy practice development for the Washington State Pharmacy Association, assistant clinical professor at the University of Washington, and chair of the Washington Patient Safety Coalitions Medication Reconciliation group. Steve Riddle, PharmD, BCPS, FASHP, is vice president of clinical affairs for Pharmacy OneSource/Wolters Kluwer Health. He is also a clinical affiliate professor at the UW School of Pharmacy, on the Washington State University College of Pharmacy Dean's Advisory Council, and the chair for the Section of Ambulatory Care Practitioners for the American Society of Health-Systems Pharmacists.</p>

<h3>Intensive Outpatient Care for Patients with Multiple Chronic Illnesses</h3>
<p>
Everyone talks about patient engagement and bending the cost curve. This webinar, originally presented on September 19, 2012, presents practical steps on how to actually achieve these goals in a way that significantly improves patient care outcomes by focusing intensive outpatient care on high-risk persons with multiple chronic conditions. While this is not a new concept, widespread adoption of these evidence-based approaches has been slow to catch on until very recently. This webinar spotlights programs underway in California, Oregon and also in Washington that have demonstrated their effectiveness in improving care and reducing costs.</p>

<h3> Using Results from Patient Experience Surveys to Improve Patient Care </h3>
<p>
This lunchtime webinar, originally presented on May 24, 2012, presents the results of the recent survey of patient experience conducted in the Puget Sound region by the Puget Sound Health Alliance, and explains how those results can be used to improve practice performance to better meet the needs of patients. Patient experience results were released on May 11, 2012 for 40 Puget Sound-area medical groups with 156 clinic locations (clinics with 3 or more primary care providers). Patient experience definitely matters to patients; it's most often how they define "quality." Patients with positive experiences return; patients with negative experiences often find a different physician. Further, positive patient experience has been shown to correlate with improved clinical outcomes.</p>
<p>Presenters<br />
Susie Dade is the deputy director for the Puget Sound Health Alliance, which sponsored the recent survey of patient experience in the Puget Sound region. Larry Morrissey, MD is a pediatrician with the Stillwater Medical Group in Stillwater, Minnesota. Dr. Morrissey has worked with the CAHPS Consortium on measuring patient experience and is a frequent presenter on how to use the results of patient experience surveys to improve practice performance.</p>

<h3>The Washington Patient-Centered Medical Home Collaborative - Lessons Learned</h3>
<p>The Patient-Centered Medical Home Collaborative was a learning process for medical teams to improve primary care for their patients. From September 2009 through September 2011, 32 teams in Washington created and operated patient-centered medical homes, under a project jointly sponsored by the Washington State Department of Health and the Washington Academy of Family Physicians. In a medical home, the physician and care team build strong relationships with the patient and the patient's family. The team coordinates care with specialists or other health providers. Patient-centered care makes the patient a partner in health care decisions. This webinar pdf presents the lessons learned from this two year collaborative.</p>
<p>Presenters<br />
Patricia Justis was manager of the Washington Patient-Centered Medical Home Collaborative, in the Practice Improvement Section of the Washington State Department of Health. Kimbra Wells Metz was director of practice transformation at the Washington Academy of Family Physicians. Both were actively involved in the implementation and evaluation of the Patient-Centered Medical Home Collaborative.</p>

<h3>End of Life Conversations in Medical Care</h3>
<p>Some of the most important, and challenging, conversations physicians can have with their patients involve planning for, and clarifying patients values about, end-of-life care decisions. The timing and structure of these conversations, and the ways to successfully engage the patient (and family members as appropriate) in what are often difficult and emotional decisions, was the subject of this webinar pdf, presented by Linda Wrede-Seaman, MD, FAAFP, FACEP, FAAHPM, a Yakima palliative medicine specialist.</p>
