Did you ever think to stop? We live in a very complex industry, and frequently, we make it complicated. This webinar, part of the WSMA and V2V Management Solutions webinar series, encourages you to look at the work you are doing on a regular basis and whether or not there are things you are doing that are making your world more complicated.
