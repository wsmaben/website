<h1 class="mobileShow">Upcoming Webinars</h1>
<p>Continuing professional development is the process of lifelong learning in which physicians acquire, through formal and informal activities, the medical and non-medical competencies they need to improve their ability to practice medicine and provide effective patient care. Engaging in continuing professional development is a professional obligation and also a prerequisite for enhancing the quality of health care. The WSMA introduced its Continuing Professional Development webinar series as part of our commitment to supporting physicians and physician assistants on their lifelong learning journey.</p>
