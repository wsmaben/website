<h1 class="mobileShow">Upcoming Webinars</h1>
<p>Continuing professional development is the process of lifelong learning in which physicians acquire, through formal and informal activities, the medical and non-medical competencies they need to improve their ability to practice medicine and provide effective patient care. Engaging in continuing professional development is a professional obligation and also a prerequisite for enhancing the quality of health care. The WSMA introduced its Continuing Professional Development webinar series as part of our commitment to supporting physicians and physician assistants on their lifelong learning journey.</p>

<h2>COVID-19 Virtual Grand Rounds (Part 4)</h2>
<p>
Given that COVID-19 will impact the medical community for the foreseeable future, this mini-series focuses on the evolution of the disease, management of COVID-19 patients, and our state's response to the pandemic—with an emphasis on what frontline physicians need to know. WSMA brings you the state's public health leaders—Vice Admiral Bono, Dr. Kathy Lofy and Dr. Charisse Fotinos—for free sessions that will offer the latest information on COVID-19 that directly impacts you, your practice and your patients. Guest speakers will share their expertise as well. The format will include 45 minutes of content and 30 minutes for a Q&A discussion with the speakers.
