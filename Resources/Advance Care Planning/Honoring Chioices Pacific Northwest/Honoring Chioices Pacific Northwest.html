<p><strong>It's a good time to have the conversation&mdash;while you are still able&mdash;on how you want to live near the end of your life so your wishes can be honored when the time comes.</strong></p>
<p>Honoring Choices&reg; Pacific Northwest is your resource to start the conversation and make a personal plan for your end-of-life care. Do it for the ones you love. Do it for yourself.</p>
<p>A joint initiative of the WSMA and the Washington State Hospital Association, Honoring Choices Pacific Northwest is inspiring adults of all ages to create their personal end-of-life care plans, with tools they need to get started and guidance for sharing those plans with their loved ones and health care teams.</p>
<p>Visit the <a href="http://www.honoringchoicespnw.org/">Honoring Choices Pacific Northwest website</a> to get started&mdash;it's never too soon to have the conversation.</p>
