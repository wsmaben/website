<h2>Emergency responders: Tips for taking care of yourself </h2>
<p>
From the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Responding to COVID-19 can take an emotional toll on you. There are things you can do to reduce secondary traumatic stress (STS) reactions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Acknowledge that STS can impact anyone helping families after a traumatic event.
    </li>
    <li>Learn the symptoms including physical (fatigue, illness) and mental (fear, withdrawal, guilt).
    </li>
    <li>Allow time for you and your family to recover from responding to the outbreak.
    </li>
    <li>Create a menu of personal self-care activities that you enjoy, such as spending time with friends and family, exercising, or reading a book.
    </li>
    <li>Take a break from media coverage of COVID-19.
    </li>
    <li>Ask for help if you feel overwhelmed or concerned that COVID-19 is affecting your ability to care for your family and patients as you did before the outbreak.
    </li>
</ul>
