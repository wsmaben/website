<h2>Sustaining Physicians and PAs During the COVID-19 Outbreak</h2>
<p>Responding to the COVID-19 crisis is already taking toll on physicians and the health care team. Remember that this is a marathon, not a sprint. We know how critical it is that you can access the support you need and practice self-care while you strive to meet your calling to provide medical care to patients. Youâ€™ll find a collection of resources from organizations that have reached out to support you. WSMA shares these resource links as a convenience and for informational purposes only; they do not constitute an endorsement or an approval by the WSMA.

<h3>WSMA offers private COVID-19 discussion forum for physicians and PAs</h3>

<h3><a name="eap"></a>WSMA calls on EAPs and PAPs to address physician concerns</h3>
<p>The WSMA has called on employee assistance programs (EAP) and physician assistance programs (PAP) to address the barriers that create skepticism and reluctance to use these services available through physician employers. The WSMA's goal is to ensure our state's physicians and advanced practitioners receive the psychological support they need, ideally using existing resources. The WSMA has asked EAPs and PAPs in Washington state to:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Change the pre-recorded greeting message on the 1-800 number to clearly communicate that all calls are confidential and HIPAA compliant.
 </li>
 <li>Establish a triage system at entry that allows people to identify themselves as clinicians at the frontline of the COVID-19 response. Deploy your most highly trained and skilled staff to support this population, including the provision of cognitive behavioral therapy.
 </li>
 <li>Develop custom communication materials targeted to clinicians at the front line of theCOVID-19 response that clearly explain that your mental health care professionals are equipped to help them navigate the COVID-19 crisis and that the services are completely confidential.
 </li>
 <li>Work with each of your clients to provide just-in-time group and 1:1 sessions to frontline clinicians while protecting the health of your staff. For example, use telehealth technology to plant multiple virtual mental health professionals inside the most impacted hospitals and/or at health care provider quarantine facilities for easy on-demand access.
 </li>
 <li>Ensure your organizations' emergency response plan includes strategies to adequately handle a surge in requests for services.</li>

<h2>CDC: For Emergency Responders, Tips for Taking Care of Yourself </h2>
<p>
Responding to COVID-19 can take an emotional toll on you. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests taking the following steps to reduce secondary traumatic stress (STS) reactions:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Acknowledge that STS can impact anyone helping families after a traumatic event.
 </li>
 <li>Learn the symptoms including physical (fatigue, illness) and mental (fear, withdrawal, guilt).
 </li>
 <li>Allow time for you and your family to recover from responding to the outbreak.
 </li>
 <li>Create a menu of personal self-care activities that you enjoy, such as spending time with friends and family, exercising, or reading a book.
 </li>
 <li>Take a break from media coverage of COVID-19.
 </li>
 <li>Ask for help if you feel overwhelmed or concerned that COVID-19 is affecting your ability to care for your family and patients as you did before the outbreak.
 </li>
