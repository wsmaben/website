<p>The outbreak of the novel coronavirus is having an immense impact on the physician profession. Many of our physicians are risking their health and the health or their families, and all of Washington's physicians are being impacted by the economic fallout of this disease as we stop elective and non-emergent procedures, move to telehealth, and as patients head our advice and stay home. Immediate financial relief is needed to ensure our physicians and practice can continue to respond, safely, to the COVID-19 crisis, and to ensure our practices can continue to provide services as the outbreak subsides.</p>
<h2>Take Action! Urge Congress for More Stimulus Support for Physician Practices</h2>
<p>The WSMA is urging Washington's Congressional representatives to prioritize direct relief funding to physician practices in the next stimulus package. We need your help. Contact your senators and representative in Congress and let them know how you and your practice have been impacted by COVID-19 and what you need to ensure you can keep caring for your patients. Hearing directly from constituents is crucial to informing lawmakers' work on your behalf. <a href="https://takeaction.wsma.org/take-action-urge-congress-for-more-stimulus-support-for-physician-practices/">Please act today</a>.
</p>

<h2>How Federal COVID-19 Relief Can Help Washington State Physicians</h2>
<p>
On April 13, the WSMA hosted a webinar where attorneys from K&amp;L Gates provided information and resources on federal financial assistance programs and informed the physician community about how to tap into these new programs. A recording of the presentation and the <a href="javascript://[Uploaded files/Resources/COVID19/4.10.20 - How Federal COVID-19 Relief Program Can Help WA.pptx - version 3_USE_Active01_304683343_2.]">slide deck</a> are available to review for those who could not participate in the live webinar.

<h3>Physician practices qualify for federal small business loan program </h3>
<p>A recent WSMA survey of physician clinics in our state found that virtually all respondents are being financially impacted by COVID-19, with several having to close their doors altogether. The federal stimulus package (a.k.a. CARES Act) is intended to provide financial relief to individuals and businesses through a number of programs. The "<a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/paycheck-protection-program-ppp">Paycheck Protection Program"</a> is likely to be of most utility to physician practices, as it provides loans of up to $10 million to qualifying businesses of less than 500 employees that under some circumstances do not need to be repaid.</p>
<p>Intended primarily as a tool for businesses impacted by COVID-19 to cover payroll costs as well as some operational expenses, the PPP loans do not require collateral and can cover up to two months of your average monthly payroll costs from the last year, plus an additional 25% of that amount (with payroll calculations capped at $100,000 per employee). Provided that the funds are used to primarily cover payroll costs, and that staff and payroll are maintained for the duration of the loan, the loan can be forgiven. Beyond payroll, up to 25% of the loan may be used for operational expenses such as rent, interest on mortgages, and utilities.</p>
<p>The PPP launches on Friday, April 3, and given the projected demand for loans, early participation is strongly encouraged. As a first step, consider reaching out to the bank your practice works with as all federally-insured financial institutions are eligible lenders. A fact sheet on the program from the Treasury Department can be found <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/PPP%20Borrower%20Information%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>, and a the application form can be found <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Paycheck-Protection-Program-Application-3-30-2020-v3.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h3>WSMA survey shows financial impact of COVID-19 on practices</h3>
<p>
The coronavirus pandemic is hitting physician practices acutely, in terms of both economic hardship and disruption to patient care. Since March 1, almost 100% (99.4%) of independent physician practices report a decrease in patient volume, resulting in millions of dollars in lost revenue. Our survey was shared with 5,000 physicians working in independent (non-networked) physician clinics in Washington state. <a href="[@]Shared_Content/News/Membership_Memo/20200403/covid_19_financial_relief">Learn more</a>
