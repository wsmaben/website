<p>
Physicians are trained to put patients first, but we can't ignore that the outbreak of the novel coronavirus will impact the profession immensely. Many of our physicians are risking their health and the health or their families, and all of Washington's physicians are being impacted by the economic fallout of this disease as we stop elective and non-emergent procedures and move to telehealth or as patients head our advice and stay home.

<h2>WSMA Presses for More Financial Relief for Physicians and Practices</h2>
<p>
With Washington's "stay home, stay healthy" order extended, and our state's outpatient practices, ambulatory surgery centers, and other facilities complying with the state's ban on non-urgent surgeries and procedures, many physician practices in Washington state face a stark reality: Even with the financial support from the CARES Act, the survival of their clinic is in question. The WSMA is urging Washington's Congressional representatives to prioritize direct relief funding to physician practices as the next round of stimulus is debated. <a href="javascript://[Uploaded files/Resources/COVID19/Congressional_Emergency_Relief_Letter_Heck.pdf]">Read the letter</a>.

<h2>Take Action: Urge Lawmakers to Support Physician Practices</h2>
<p>
Lawmakers in Washington D.C. and Washington state are engaged in ongoing efforts to provide emergency support to our state's businesses. They need to hear from you on what your practice needs in the coming days, weeks, and months as the response effort continues.

<h2>Physician Practices Qualify for Federal Small Business Loan Program </h2>
<p>A recent WSMA survey of physician clinics in our state found that virtually all respondents are being financially impacted by COVID-19, with several having to close their doors altogether. The federal stimulus package (a.k.a. CARES Act) is intended to provide financial relief to individuals and businesses through a number of programs. The "<a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/paycheck-protection-program-ppp">Paycheck Protection Program"</a> is likely to be of most utility to physician practices, as it provides loans of up to $10 million to qualifying businesses of less than 500 employees that under some circumstances do not need to be repaid.</p>
<p>Intended primarily as a tool for businesses impacted by COVID-19 to cover payroll costs as well as some operational expenses, the PPP loans do not require collateral and can cover up to two months of your average monthly payroll costs from the last year, plus an additional 25% of that amount (with payroll calculations capped at $100,000 per employee). Provided that the funds are used to primarily cover payroll costs, and that staff and payroll are maintained for the duration of the loan, the loan can be forgiven. Beyond payroll, up to 25% of the loan may be used for operational expenses such as rent, interest on mortgages, and utilities.</p>
<p>The PPP launches on Friday, April 3, and given the projected demand for loans, early participation is strongly encouraged. As a first step, consider reaching out to the bank your practice works with as all federally-insured financial institutions are eligible lenders. A fact sheet on the program from the Treasury Department can be found <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/PPP%20Borrower%20Information%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>, and a the application form can be found <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Paycheck-Protection-Program-Application-3-30-2020-v3.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
