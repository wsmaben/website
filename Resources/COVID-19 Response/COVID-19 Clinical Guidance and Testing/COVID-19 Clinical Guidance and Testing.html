<p><strong>Workforce protections</strong></p>
<p>In the face of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Washington Healthcare Forum Work Group, made up of leading health care organizations in Washington state, including the WSMA, are working together to create a common set of high-level recommendations that individual organizations will use to develop their own individual policies and procedures related to the protection of their employees and patients.</p>

<p>The WSMA is working every policy and advocacy lever to try and increase access to testing supplies and protective equipment during this crisis.

<h2>Caring for High-Risk COVID-19 Patients</h2>
<p>Respecting Choices® has just announced it is offering an <a href="https://respectingchoices.org/covid-19-resources/">open-source toolkit</a> for those caring for high-risk COVID-19 patients. These patients are feeling especially vulnerable, as are their loved ones. The toolkit includes guidance for conversations about treatment preferences before a medical crisis, as well as resources to support specific treatment decisions in high-risk individuals.</p>
<p>Washington Health Care Authority <a href="https://www.hca.wa.gov/about-hca/healthier-washington/patient-decision-aids-pdas">certified</a>&nbsp;Respecting Choices’ patient decision aids on “<a href="https://respectingchoices.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Decision_Aid_Help_with_Breathing.pdf">Help with Breathing</a>” and “<a href="https://respectingchoices.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Decision_Aid_CPR.pdf">CPR</a>”; both of which are included in Respecting Choices’ open-source <a href="https://respectingchoices.org/covid-19-resources/">toolkit</a>, along with many other resources.</p>
<p>Additionally, Honoring Choices<sup>®</sup> Pacific Northwest, jointly sponsored by the WSMA Foundation and the Washington State Hospital Association, has partnered with Respecting Choices to offer an online course to physicians and advanced practitioners in Washington state. Through a grant from The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the online modules are&nbsp;<strong>free of charge</strong> for WSMA members and members of the Honoring Choices PNW initiative (use discount code: HCPNWPartner) until February 2021. Designed for physicians and advanced practitioners, the three-module online course will enhance your ability to effectively introduce and motivate patients to participate in basic advance care planning (ACP); guide and document basic ACP conversations with patients and families; and successfully integrate and bill for basic ACP in everyday practice. Get started at: <a href="https://wsma.org/BasicACPModules">wsma.org/BasicACPModules</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="surgery"></a>WSMA Guidance on Elective Surgeries and Procedures</h2>
<p>Following Gov. Inslee's <a href="https://www.governor.wa.gov/news-media/inslee-orders-halt-elective-surgeries-and-dental-services-reserve-critical-equipment">proclamation banning elective surgeries and procedures</a>, the WSMA, together with over 20 state specialty and county medical societies, issued guidance for physicians in Washington state.</p>
<p>Key takeaways:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The WSMA strongly recommends that physicians postpone or cancel elective surgeries and procedures currently scheduled within the next three months, if the delay will not cause harm to patients.</li>
    <li>The WSMA encourages practices to move routine care and chronic care management to telehealth. Resources and guidance are available on WSMA's <a href="https://wsma.org/WSMA/Resources/COVID-19_Response/Telehealth_and_Reimbursement/WSMA/Resources/COVID-19/Prepare_Your_Practice_for_COVID-19/Prepare_Your_Practice_for_COVID-19.aspx?hkey=ed7e0075-97a3-489f-b858-92a741fc58ae">COVID-19 Telehealth and Reimbursement</a> page.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is not guidance the WSMA issues lightly. We feel it is necessary to stay proactive during these critical decision-making times. Together, we may still be able to prevent overwhelming our hospital systems at a time when we lack personal protection equipment (PPE) supplies in Washington state. Washington State Department of Health recently released <a href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/NovelCoronavirusOutbreak2020/PPEPrioritization">Guidelines for Prioritization of Allocation of Personal Protective Equipment</a> and outpatient facilities are in Tier 3, as PPE resources are prioritized for confirmed case management.</p>
<p>For surgeons, the American College of Surgeons has issued guidance for triage non-emergent surgical procedures. That information is appended to the <a href="javascript://[Uploaded files/Resources/COVID19/covid_19_elective_surgeries_wsma_statement_031920_final_2.pdf]">WSMA guidance</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Washington Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics (WCAAP) has outlined <a href="https://wcaap.org/physicians/coronavirus-covid-19-resources/">promising practices to reduce spread of infection in primary care pediatrics and provide care in absence of adequate PPE</a>.</p>

The governor announced that Washington state will receive <a href="https://twitter.com/GovInslee/status/1241166662465798146">a shipment from the national stockpile this weekend</a>. Our understanding is that the Northwest Regional Health Care Network and Department of Health will be <a href="javascript://[Uploaded files/Resources/COVID19/PPE_prioritization_DOH_3-11-20.pdf]">prioritizing supplies based on COVID-19 cases</a>.

The WSMA is in conversations with the City and others to see how we can get supplies to clinics in need. (March 20, 2020)</p>
<p>The Washington State Department of Health received 8,000 additional COVID-19 test kits from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. DOH is working to distribute the new supplies to local health agencies in the areas hardest hit by the COVID-19 virus thus far—King, Pierce, and Snohomish counties. These additional test kits are intended to increase capacity for testing of high-risk populations, including health care providers and first responders. FEMA and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services plan to provide additional test kits and related equipment to Washington state as these materials become available.&nbsp;<a href="https://coronavirus.wa.gov/news/washington-receives-8000-additional-covid-19-test-kits">Read the announcement</a>.
