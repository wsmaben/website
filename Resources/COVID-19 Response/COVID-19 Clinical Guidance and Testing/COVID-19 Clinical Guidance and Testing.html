<h2>COVID-19 Testing</h2>
<p>The WSMA is working every policy and advocacy lever to try and increase access to testing supplies and protective equipment during this crisis. We will keep physicians and PAs throughout Washington updated as we learn more. Review the below information for the latest on testing and PPE.</p>
<h3>Clinical judgment and COVID-19 testing</h3>
<!-- Content Below -->
<p>According to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/clinical-criteria.html">CDC clinical guidance updated March 4</a>, clinicians should use their judgment to determine if a patient has signs and symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and whether the patient should be tested. Decisions on which patients receive testing should be based on the local epidemiology of COVID-19, as well as the clinical course of illness. Most patients with confirmed COVID-19 have developed fever and/or symptoms of acute respiratory illness (e.g., cough, difficulty breathing). Clinicians are strongly encouraged to test for other causes of respiratory illness, including infections such as influenza. </p>
<p>For more guidance, download COVID-19 Testing Information for Healthcare Providers from the DOH <a href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/NovelCoronavirusOutbreak2020/HealthcareProviders">Health care provider resources and recommendations</a> page. </p>
<!--<p>The following patients with COVID-19 symptoms are considered at highest priority for testing:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Health care workers.</li>
    <li>Patients in other public safety occupations (e.g., law enforcement, fire fighter, EMS).</li>
    <li>Patients involved in an illness cluster in a facility or institution (e.g., health care, school, corrections, shelters).</li>
    <li>Patients with severe lower respiratory illness (hospitalized or fatal).</li>
    <li>Patients with worsening symptoms.</li>
    <li>Patients older than 60 years.</li>
    <li>Patients with underlying medical conditions.</li>
    <li>Pregnant women.</li>
    <li>Any other patients can be tested per physician and health care provider judgment.</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, the Washington State Department of Health does not recommend testing asymptomatic persons. However, you can consider testing asymptomatic persons if they have been in close contact with a confirmed case. A negative test result does not rule out an infection.</p>

<h3>Where to send specimens for COVID-19 testing</h3>
<!-- Content Below -->
<p><strong>From the Washington State Department of Health:
</strong></p>
<p>
Physicians and health care providers should send specimens for COVID-19 testing to <a href="https://www.labcorp.com/tests/139900/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-naa">LabCorp</a>, <a href="https://www.questdiagnostics.com/home/Covid-19/">Quest Diagnostics</a> and other commercial laboratories doing testing.</p>
<p>Until the <a href="https://depts.washington.edu/uwviro/">UW Medicine Virology Laboratory </a> has more testing capacity readily available, they are prioritizing specimens from hospitalized patients, health care workers and first responders.</p>
<p>Limited testing is available from the Washington's public health laboratories. Public health labs are accepting specimens from health care workers, patients in other public safety occupations (e.g., law enforcement, fire fighter, EMS), patients involved in an illness cluster in a facility or group (e.g., health care, school, corrections, business), and patients with no health insurance. If seeking testing at PHL, call your <a href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/AboutUs/PublicHealthSystem/LocalHealthJurisdictions">local health jurisdiction</a> to discuss the case. If possible, please call 8 a.m.–4:30 p.m. </p>
<p>For more guidance from the DOH, see COVID-19 Testing Information for Healthcare Providers on the DOH <a href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/NovelCoronavirusOutbreak2020/HealthcareProviders">Health care provider resources and recommendations</a> page. </p>
<p><strong>From the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control:
</strong></p>
<p>As availability of diagnostic testing for COVID-19 increases, clinicians will be able to access laboratory tests for diagnosing COVID-19 through clinical laboratories performing tests authorized by FDA under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). Clinicians should consult with the laboratories that routinely perform their diagnostic services to see how best to access testing for COVID-19. The FDA offers a <a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/emergency-use-authorizations#coronavirus2019">list of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Emergency Use Authorizations </a>provided by the agency.</p>
<h3>Recommendations for health care workforce protections and swab collection</h3>
<!-- Content Below -->
<p>In the face of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Washington Healthcare Forum Work Group, made up of leading health care organizations in Washington state, including the WSMA, are working together to create a common set of high-level recommendations that individual organizations will use to develop their own individual policies and procedures related to the protection of their employees and patients.</p>
<p>The first two consensus recommendations address infection prevention and control precautions and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and management of health care personnel with potential exposure to COVID-19.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Toplines:</p>
<ol style="margin-left: 40px;">
    <li>Health care organizations will implement policies and procedures consistent with the <a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-rights-roles-respon-hw-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=bcabd401_0">World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for infection prevention and control during health care when a novel coronavirus (nCoV) infection is suspected</a>, as endorsed by the Washington State Department of Health.</li>
    <li>Health care organizations will implement policies and procedures based on the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-risk-assesment-hcp.html">CDC’s Interim U.S. Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Healthcare Personnel with Potential Exposure in a Healthcare Setting to Patients with Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)</a>, including the consideration to allow asymptomatic health care personnel who have had an exposure to a COVID-19 patient to continue to work with daily symptom monitoring in consultation with their employee health services.</li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">To read the recommendations in full, download <a href="https://wsma.org/doc_library/news/consensus_position_protection_030820_wsma_wsha.pdf">Consensus Recommendations for the Protection of Health Care Personnel and Patients Related to COVID-19</a>. (March 8, 2020)</p>
<!--HIDE-->
<p>The next set of consensus recommendations relates to collection of nasopharyngeal (NP) or oropharyngeal (OP) swabs. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Toplines:</p>
<ol style="margin-left: 40px;">
    <li>The WHO has continued to recommend droplet and contact precautions, based on SARS-CoV-2 being primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets, reserving airborne precautions for those patients undergoing aerosol-generating procedures. Washington state led the change to adopt the WHO guidelines.</li>

The City of Seattle <a href="https://durkan.seattle.gov/2020/03/city-of-seattle-leading-coordinated-effort-to-collect-critically-needed-personal-protective-equipment-for-first-responders-medical-professionals-on-the-frontlines-of-covid-19-response/">announced a donation drive in partnership with Goodwill</a>. The WSMA is in conversations with the City and others to see how we can get supplies to clinics in need. (March 20, 2020)</p>
<p>The Washington State Department of Health received 8,000 additional COVID-19 test kits from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. DOH is working to distribute the new supplies to local health agencies in the areas hardest hit by the COVID-19 virus thus far—King, Pierce, and Snohomish counties. These additional test kits are intended to increase capacity for testing of high-risk populations, including health care providers and first responders. FEMA and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services plan to provide additional test kits and related equipment to Washington state as these materials become available.<a href="https://coronavirus.wa.gov/news/washington-receives-8000-additional-covid-19-test-kits">Read the announcement</a>.
