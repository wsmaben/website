<h2>Clinical Judgment and COVID-19 Testing</h2>
<!-- Content Below -->
<p>According to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/clinical-criteria.html">CDC clinical guidance updated March 4</a>, clinicians should use their judgment to determine if a patient has signs and symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and whether the patient should be tested. Decisions on which patients receive testing should be based on the local epidemiology of COVID-19, as well as the clinical course of illness. Most patients with confirmed COVID-19 have developed fever and/or symptoms of acute respiratory illness (e.g., cough, difficulty breathing). Clinicians are strongly encouraged to test for other causes of respiratory illness, including infections such as influenza.</p>
<p>The following patients with COVID-19 symptoms are considered at highest priority for testing:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Health care workers.</li>
    <li>Patients in other public safety occupations (e.g., law enforcement, fire fighter, EMS).</li>
    <li>Patients involved in an illness cluster in a facility or institution (e.g., health care, school, corrections, shelters).</li>
    <li>Patients with severe lower respiratory illness (hospitalized or fatal).</li>
    <li>Patients with worsening symptoms.</li>
    <li>Patients older than 60 years.</li>
    <li>Patients with underlying medical conditions.</li>
    <li>Pregnant women.</li>
    <li>Any other patients can be tested per physician and health care provider judgment.</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, the Washington State Department of Health does not recommend testing asymptomatic persons. However, you can consider testing asymptomatic persons if they have been in close contact with a confirmed case. A negative test result does not rule out an infection.</p>

<h2>How to Access and Report COVID-19 Tests</h2>
<!-- Content Below -->
<h3>Washington State Department of Health COVID-19 testing guidance</h3>
<p><em>Updated March 17, 2020</em></p>
<p>
Physicians and health care providers should send specimens for COVID-19 testing to <a href="https://www.labcorp.com/tests/139900/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-naa">LabCorp</a>, <a href="https://www.questdiagnostics.com/home/Covid-19/">Quest Diagnostics</a> and other commercial laboratories doing testing.</p>
<p>Until the <a href="https://depts.washington.edu/uwviro/">UW Medicine Virology Laboratory </a> has more testing capacity readily available, they are prioritizing specimens from hospitalized patients, health care workers and first responders.</p>
<p>Limited testing is available from the Washington's public health laboratories. Public health labs are accepting specimens from health care workers, patients in other public safety occupations (e.g., law enforcement, fire fighter, EMS), patients involved in an illness cluster in a facility or group (e.g., health care, school, corrections, business), and patients with no health insurance. If seeking testing at PHL, call your <a href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/AboutUs/PublicHealthSystem/LocalHealthJurisdictions">local health jurisdiction</a> to discuss the case. If possible, please call 8 a.m.–4:30 p.m. </p>

<h3>CDC COVID-19 testing guidance</h3>
<p>As availability of diagnostic testing for COVID-19 increases, clinicians will be able to access laboratory tests for diagnosing COVID-19 through clinical laboratories performing tests authorized by FDA under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). Clinicians should consult with the laboratories that routinely perform their diagnostic services to see how best to access testing for COVID-19. The FDA offers a <a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/emergency-use-authorizations#coronavirus2019">list of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Emergency Use Authorizations </a>provided by the agency.</p>
<h2>Recommendations for Health Care Workforce Protections &amp; Swab Collection</h2>
<!-- Content Below -->
<p>In the face of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Washington Healthcare Forum Work Group, made up of leading health care organizations in Washington state, including the WSMA, are working together to create a common set of high-level recommendations that individual organizations will use to develop their own individual policies and procedures related to the protection of their employees and patients.</p>
<p>The first two consensus recommendations address infection prevention and control precautions and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and management of health care personnel with potential exposure to COVID-19.</p>
<ol style="margin-left: 40px;">
    <li>Health care organizations will implement policies and procedures consistent with the <a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-rights-roles-respon-hw-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=bcabd401_0">World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for infection prevention and control during health care when a novel coronavirus (nCoV) infection is suspected</a>, as endorsed by the Washington State Department of Health.</li>
    <li>Health care organizations will implement policies and procedures based on the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-risk-assesment-hcp.html">CDC’s Interim U.S. Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Healthcare Personnel with Potential Exposure in a Healthcare Setting to Patients with Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)</a>, including the consideration to allow asymptomatic health care personnel who have had an exposure to a COVID-19 patient to continue to work with daily symptom monitoring in consultation with their employee health services.</li>
</ol>
<p>Download the Washington Healthcare Forum Work Group’s <a href="https://wsma.org/doc_library/news/consensus_position_protection_030820_wsma_wsha.pdf">Consensus Recommendations for the Protection of Health Care Personnel and Patients Related to COVID-19</a> (March 8, 2020).</p>
<p>The next set of consensus recommendations relates to collection of nasopharyngeal (NP) or oropharyngeal (OP) swabs. COVID-19 is an emerging disease and our knowledge about the natural history, transmission, clinical course and treatment is constantly updated. When the CDC announced isolation precautions with associated recommendations for personal protective equipment, they differed from the World Health Organization by recommending airborne and contact precautions due to this being a new virus. The WHO has continued to recommend droplet and contact precautions, based on SARS-CoV-2 being primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets, reserving airborne precautions for those patients undergoing aerosol-generating procedures. Washington state led the change to adopt the WHO guidelines and now Oregon has followed. Similar CDC changes are expected soon.</p>
<h4>Aerosol-generating procedures</h4>
<p>A list of aerosol-generating procedures that would still require airborne precautions follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Intubation, extubation and related procedures such as manual ventilation and open suctioning.</li>
    <li>Tracheotomy and tracheostomy procedures (insertion, open suctioning, removal).</li>
    <li>Bronchoscopy.</li>
    <li>Surgery and post-mortem procedures involving high-speed devices.</li>
    <li>Some dental procedures (such as high-speed drilling).</li>
    <li>Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) such as bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) and continuous positive airway pressure ventilation (CPAP).</li>
    <li>High-frequency oscillating ventilation (HFOV).</li>
    <li>High-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO), also called high-flow nasal cannula.</li>
    <li>Induction of sputum.</li>
    <li>Medication administration via continuous nebulizer.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mechanical ventilation</span> – judged on a case-by-case basis by the ICU attending with infectious disease and/or infection prevention</p>
<ul>
    <li>As long as the ICU ventilator circuit has a filter in place and the circuit remains closed, airborne precautions are not needed.</li>
    <li>If patient care requires, or is at risk for, frequent breaks in the circuit, airborne precautions should be used.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Collection of nasopharyngeal (NP) or oropharyngeal (OP) swabs</h4>
<p>Outpatient collection of NP or OP swabs is not considered an aerosol generating procedure. This was determined in conjunction with Infectious Disease and Infection Prevention providers from around the region.</p>
<p>Providers collecting such samples should use droplet and contact precautions with mask, eye protection, gown and gloves. Collecting nasopharyngeal swabs should be done correctly to maximize the sensitivity and specificity of the test result; and staff education will be provided.</p>
<p>Severely ill patients requiring hospitalization should have testing deferred prior to transfer. Inpatient collection of NP or OP swabs for critically ill or highly symptomatic patients may still require the addition of airborne precautions. The attending physician in conjunction with ID or Infection Prevention can assist with this determination.</p>
<p>The Work Group will continue to update these recommendations as new information becomes available and will be developing future recommendations to further align and coordinate our collective response.</p>
