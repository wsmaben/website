<h2>COVID-19 Evaluating, Testing, and Protection</h2>
<!--HIDE<p>The WSMA is working every policy and advocacy lever to try and increase access to testing supplies and protective equipment during this crisis. The WSMA and nearly 30 medical societies across the state are urging Washington state's new COVID-19 response director, Vice Admiral Raquel C. Bono, MD, to: 1.) Globally assess the current supplies of PPE at the state level, and 2.) Create a more comprehensive distribution model that considers the critical role of ambulatory sites. <a href="javascript://[Uploaded files/Resources/COVID19/ppe_sign_on_letter_002.pdf]">Read the letter</a>, delivered March 26, 2020. Additionally, the WSMA is conducting surveys of independent docs/clinics to determine need, to help advocate for testing supplies in our rural and non-Puget Sounds impacted areas. The City of Seattle <a href="https://durkan.seattle.gov/2020/03/city-of-seattle-leading-coordinated-effort-to-collect-critically-needed-personal-protective-equipment-for-first-responders-medical-professionals-on-the-frontlines-of-covid-19-response/">announced a donation drive in partnership with Goodwill</a>. The WSMA is in conversations with the City and others to see how we can get supplies to clinics in need. We will keep physicians and PAs throughout Washington updated as we learn more on this evolving situation.

The governor announced that Washington state will receive <a href="https://twitter.com/GovInslee/status/1241166662465798146">a shipment from the national stockpile this weekend</a>. Our understanding is that the Northwest Regional Health Care Network and Department of Health will be <a href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/NovelCoronavirusOutbreak2020/PPEPrioritization">prioritizing supplies based on COVID-19 cases</a>.

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Washington State Department of Health received 8,000 additional COVID-19 test kits from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. DOH is working to distribute the new supplies to local health agencies in the areas hardest hit by the COVID-19 virus thus far—King, Pierce, and Snohomish counties. These additional test kits are intended to increase capacity for testing of high-risk populations, including health care providers and first responders. FEMA and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services plan to provide additional test kits and related equipment to Washington state as these materials become available. <a href="https://coronavirus.wa.gov/news/washington-receives-8000-additional-covid-19-test-kits">Read the announcement</a>.
