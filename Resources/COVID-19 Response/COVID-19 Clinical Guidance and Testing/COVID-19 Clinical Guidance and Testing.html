<h3>Clinical judgment and COVID-19 testing</h3>
<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/clinical-criteria.html">CDC clinical guidance updated March 4</a>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/clinical-criteria.html">CDC clinical guidance updated March 4</a>, clinicians should use their judgment to determine if a patient has signs and symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and whether the patient should be tested. Decisions on which patients receive testing should be based on the local epidemiology of COVID-19, as well as the clinical course of illness. Most patients with confirmed COVID-19 have developed fever and/or symptoms of acute respiratory illness (e.g., cough, difficulty breathing). Clinicians are strongly encouraged to test for other causes of respiratory illness, including infections such as influenza. </p>
<p>For more guidance, download COVID-19 Testing Information for Healthcare Providers from the DOH <a href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/NovelCoronavirusOutbreak2020/HealthcareProviders">Health care provider resources and recommendations</a> page. </p>

<h3>Where to send specimens for COVID-19 testing</h3>

<p><strong>From the Washington State Department of Health:
</strong></p>
<p>
Physicians and health care providers should send specimens for COVID-19 testing to <a href="https://www.labcorp.com/tests/139900/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-naa">LabCorp</a>, <a href="https://www.questdiagnostics.com/home/Covid-19/">Quest Diagnostics</a> and other commercial laboratories doing testing.</p>
<p>Until the <a href="https://depts.washington.edu/uwviro/">UW Medicine Virology Laboratory </a> has more testing capacity readily available, they are prioritizing specimens from hospitalized patients, health care workers and first responders.</p>
<p>Limited testing is available from the Washington's public health laboratories. Public health labs are accepting specimens from health care workers, patients in other public safety occupations (e.g., law enforcement, fire fighter, EMS), patients involved in an illness cluster in a facility or group (e.g., health care, school, corrections, business), and patients with no health insurance. If seeking testing at PHL, call your <a href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/AboutUs/PublicHealthSystem/LocalHealthJurisdictions">local health jurisdiction</a> to discuss the case. If possible, please call 8 a.m.–4:30 p.m. </p>
<p>For more guidance from the DOH, see COVID-19 Testing Information for Healthcare Providers on the DOH <a href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/NovelCoronavirusOutbreak2020/HealthcareProviders">Health care provider resources and recommendations</a> page. </p>
<p><strong>From the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control:
</strong></p>
<p>As availability of diagnostic testing for COVID-19 increases, clinicians will be able to access laboratory tests for diagnosing COVID-19 through clinical laboratories performing tests authorized by FDA under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). Clinicians should consult with the laboratories that routinely perform their diagnostic services to see how best to access testing for COVID-19. The FDA offers a <a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/emergency-use-authorizations#coronavirus2019">list of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Emergency Use Authorizations </a>provided by the agency.</p>
<h3>Recommendations for health care workforce protections and swab collection</h3>

<p>In the face of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Washington Healthcare Forum Work Group, made up of leading health care organizations in Washington state, including the WSMA, are working together to create a common set of high-level recommendations that individual organizations will use to develop their own individual policies and procedures related to the protection of their employees and patients.</p>
<p>The first two consensus recommendations address infection prevention and control precautions and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and management of health care personnel with potential exposure to COVID-19.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Toplines:</p>
<ol style="margin-left: 40px;">
    <li>Health care organizations will implement policies and procedures consistent with the <a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-rights-roles-respon-hw-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=bcabd401_0">World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for infection prevention and control during health care when a novel coronavirus (nCoV) infection is suspected</a>, as endorsed by the Washington State Department of Health.</li>
    <li>Health care organizations will implement policies and procedures based on the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-risk-assesment-hcp.html">CDC’s Interim U.S. Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Healthcare Personnel with Potential Exposure in a Healthcare Setting to Patients with Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)</a>, including the consideration to allow asymptomatic health care personnel who have had an exposure to a COVID-19 patient to continue to work with daily symptom monitoring in consultation with their employee health services.</li>

<p>The next set of consensus recommendations relates to collection of nasopharyngeal (NP) or oropharyngeal (OP) swabs. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Toplines:</p>
<ol style="margin-left: 40px;">
    <li>The WHO has continued to recommend droplet and contact precautions, based on SARS-CoV-2 being primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets, reserving airborne precautions for those patients undergoing aerosol-generating procedures. Washington state led the change to adopt the WHO guidelines.</li>

<h2>Caring for High-Risk COVID-19 Patients</h2>
<p>Respecting Choices® has just announced it is offering an <a href="https://respectingchoices.org/covid-19-resources/">open-source toolkit</a> for those caring for high-risk COVID-19 patients. These patients are feeling especially vulnerable, as are their loved ones. The toolkit includes guidance for conversations about treatment preferences before a medical crisis, as well as resources to support specific treatment decisions in high-risk individuals.</p>
<p>Washington Health Care Authority <a href="https://www.hca.wa.gov/about-hca/healthier-washington/patient-decision-aids-pdas">certified</a>&nbsp;Respecting Choices’ patient decision aids on “<a href="https://respectingchoices.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Decision_Aid_Help_with_Breathing.pdf">Help with Breathing</a>” and “<a href="https://respectingchoices.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Decision_Aid_CPR.pdf">CPR</a>”; both of which are included in Respecting Choices’ open-source <a href="https://respectingchoices.org/covid-19-resources/">toolkit</a>, along with many other resources.</p>
<p>Additionally, Honoring Choices<sup>®</sup> Pacific Northwest, jointly sponsored by the WSMA Foundation and the Washington State Hospital Association, has partnered with Respecting Choices to offer an online course to physicians and advanced practitioners in Washington state. Through a grant from The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the online modules are&nbsp;<strong>free of charge</strong> for WSMA members and members of the Honoring Choices PNW initiative (use discount code: HCPNWPartner) until February 2021.

Get started at: <a href="https://wsma.org/BasicACPModules">wsma.org/BasicACPModules</a>.</p>
<h2>WSMA Guidance on Elective Surgeries and Procedures</h2>
<p>Following Gov. Inslee's <a href="https://www.governor.wa.gov/news-media/inslee-orders-halt-elective-surgeries-and-dental-services-reserve-critical-equipment">proclamation banning elective surgeries and procedures</a>, the WSMA, together with over 20 state specialty and county medical societies, issued guidance for physicians in Washington state.</p>
<p>Key takeaways:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The WSMA strongly recommends that physicians postpone or cancel elective surgeries and procedures currently scheduled within the next three months, if the delay will not cause harm to patients.</li>
    <li>The WSMA encourages practices to move routine care and chronic care management to telehealth. Resources and guidance are available on WSMA's <a href="https://wsma.org/WSMA/Resources/COVID-19_Response/Telehealth_and_Reimbursement/WSMA/Resources/COVID-19/Prepare_Your_Practice_for_COVID-19/Prepare_Your_Practice_for_COVID-19.aspx?hkey=ed7e0075-97a3-489f-b858-92a741fc58ae">COVID-19 Telehealth and Reimbursement</a> page.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is not guidance the WSMA issues lightly. We feel it is necessary to stay proactive during these critical decision-making times. Together, we may still be able to prevent overwhelming our hospital systems at a time when we lack personal protection equipment (PPE) supplies in Washington state. Washington State Department of Health recently released <a href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/NovelCoronavirusOutbreak2020/PPEPrioritization">Guidelines for Prioritization of Allocation of Personal Protective Equipment</a> and outpatient facilities are in Tier 3, as PPE resources are prioritized for confirmed case management.</p>
<p>For surgeons, the American College of Surgeons has issued guidance for triage non-emergent surgical procedures. That information is appended to the <a href="javascript://[Uploaded files/Resources/COVID19/covid_19_elective_surgeries_wsma_statement_031920_final_2.pdf]">WSMA guidance</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Washington Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics (WCAAP) has outlined <a href="https://wcaap.org/physicians/coronavirus-covid-19-resources/">promising practices to reduce spread of infection in primary care pediatrics and provide care in absence of adequate PPE</a>.</p>

The WSMA is in conversations with the City and others to see how we can get supplies to clinics in need. (March 20, 2020)</p>
<p>The Washington State Department of Health received 8,000 additional COVID-19 test kits from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. DOH is working to distribute the new supplies to local health agencies in the areas hardest hit by the COVID-19 virus thus far—King, Pierce, and Snohomish counties. These additional test kits are intended to increase capacity for testing of high-risk populations, including health care providers and first responders. FEMA and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services plan to provide additional test kits and related equipment to Washington state as these materials become available.&nbsp;<a href="https://coronavirus.wa.gov/news/washington-receives-8000-additional-covid-19-test-kits">Read the announcement</a>.
