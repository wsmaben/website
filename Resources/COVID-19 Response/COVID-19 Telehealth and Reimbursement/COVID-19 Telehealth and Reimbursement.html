<p>
During the COVID-19 crisis, sensible telehealth and reimbursement policies are essential to allow physicians and practices to continue providing preventive, acute, and chronic care for their patients, to provide care in a manner that keeps our health care workforce safe, and to protect physician practice viability.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Here's what you need to know to best utilize telehealth in your practice:</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>HIPAA relaxed at the federal level:</strong> The Health and Human Services agency has <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/special-topics/emergency-preparedness/notification-enforcement-discretion-telehealth/index.html">relaxed HIPAA regulations</a> for physicians using telehealth to treat their patients. This change allows for the use of video chat applications (FaceTime, Skype, etc.) to provide telehealth services.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Office of the Insurance Commissioner OKs the use of non-HIPAA compliant platforms including telephone:</strong> The OIC has <a href="https://www.insurance.wa.gov/sites/default/files/documents/emergency-order-20-02_3.pdf?utm_content=&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_name=&amp;utm_source=govdelivery&amp;utm_term=">issued an order</a> requiring all state-regulated carriers to permit and reimburse for care provided over non-HIPAA compliant platforms &ndash; including video chat applications and the telephone.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Governor Inslee's proclamation requires payment parity:</strong> The <a href="https://www.insurance.wa.gov/sites/default/files/documents/emergency-order-20-02_3.pdf?utm_content=&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_name=&amp;utm_source=govdelivery&amp;utm_term=">proclamation implements SB 5385</a> &ndash; requiring telemedicine services to be paid for at parity with face-to-face services &ndash; immediately.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Medicaid also paying at parity:</strong> Medicaid, including MCOs and FFS, are <a href="https://www.hca.wa.gov/health-care-services-and-supports/hca-supports-increased-telehealth-options-medicaid-clients-public">both paying for telehealth</a> &ndash; including services administered over the telephone &ndash; at parity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Medicare relaxing telehealth requirements:</strong> The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services has <a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/medicare-telemedicine-health-care-provider-fact-sheet">expanded telehealth services</a> and <a href="https://www.cms.gov/files/document/covid-19-physicians-and-practitioners.pdf" target="_blank">waived certain telemedicine regulations</a> for Medicare beneficiaries during the 2019 Novel Coronavirus pandemic.

<p>
Telemedicine allows patients to continue to receive the care they need to manage chronic conditions or minor illness from the safety of their own home. During this public health crisis, allowing patients to receive health care in their homes is safer for the patient as well as the practitioner and their staff.
</p>
<p>
Larger practices and systems currently using telehealth technology are working to scale up those services as demand for COVID-19 testing increases. Smaller and midsized physician practices may want to consider adopting telehealth, which is <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/preparing-communities.html">recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> to help mitigate the impact and prevent the spread of COVID-19. Telehealth can:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Enable people to access care and initial screenings from their home.</li>
 <li>Minimize the demands on in-person primary care offices, urgent care centers, and emergency departments.</li>
 <li>Minimize the use of personal protective equipment like gloves and masks.</li>
 <li>Reduce the risk of exposure to patients and medical care teams.</li>
 <li>Ensure that treatment is available for high-need patients.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Setting up telehealth at your practice</h3>
<p>
The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services has released a comprehensive toolkit for general practitioners that contains links to reliable sources of information on telehealth and telemedicine, which will reduce the amount of time providers spend searching for answers and increase their time with patients. Many of these links will help physicians learn about the general concept of telehealth, choose telemedicine vendors, initiate a telemedicine program, monitor patients remotely, and develop documentation tools. Additionally, the information contained within each toolkit will also outline temporary virtual services that could be used to treat patients during this specific period of time. Download the <a href="https://www.cms.gov/files/document/general-telemedicine-toolkit.pdf" target="_blank">Telehealth Toolkit for General Practitioners</a>. (March 23, 2020)
</p>
<p>
The Health Care Authority has purchased a limited number of licenses for Zoom, a video conferencing technology that can help physicians provide virtual care. The HCA will distribute the licenses free of charge to physicians and providers who have a meaningful need and who don't already have access to telehealth technology, including physicians in smaller practices. Visit <a href="https://www.hca.wa.gov/billers-providers-partners/prior-authorization-claims-and-billing/request-zoom-license-connect">the HCA website to apply</a>. We believe this offer by the HCA is a direct result of our advocacy on behalf of our small practice physicians, and we thank the agency for making these available. (March 20, 2020)

The WSMA is advocating for payment parity for delivering telemedicine services. Learn more about our telehealth advocacy efforts and find breaking telehealth developments below.
</p>
<h3>Gov. Inslee's proclamation on payment parity</h3>
<p>
On March 25, Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee issued a <a href="https://www.governor.wa.gov/sites/default/files/proclamations/20-29%20Coronovirus%20OIC%20%28tmp%29.pdf?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery">proclamation</a> that implemented Senate Bill 5385 immediately. Among other provisions, SB 5385 requires carriers to pay for telemedicine services at parity with face-to-face visits. This change applies to all state-regulated plans. However, this change is not applicable to certain self-insured/ERISA plans that are not regulated by the state. Gov. Inslee's proclamation will expire at midnight on April 24, 2020. For the order to be renewed, the governor will need approval from legislative leadership.
</p>
<h3>Medicaid</h3>
<p>
The Washington State Health Care Authority (HCA) has released guidance to help address your questions on billing Apple Health (Medicaid) fee-for-service programs, as well as managed care organizations, for services including telehealth &ndash; <a href="https://www.hca.wa.gov/assets/billers-and-providers/Clinical-policy-and-billing-for-COVID-19-FAQ.pdf" target="_blank">Apple Health (Medicaid) clinical policy and billing for COVID-19</a>. (March 27, 2020) The guidance provides CPT codes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Note</strong> : The FAQ specifies that telemedicine needs to be delivered via HIPAA-compliant communications; however, the federal government announced that it has relaxed HIPAA rules for health care providers using telehealth in response to COVID-19. See "Telehealth Exceptions" section below.
</p>
<p>
HCA also offers the following guidance &ndash; <a href="https://www.hca.wa.gov/assets/billers-and-providers/telehealth-brief-for-COVID-03-2020.pdf" target="_blank">Apple Health (Medicaid) coverage for telemedicine services</a>. (March 14, 2020)

<h3>Medicare</h3>
<p>
As a result of WSMA and other physician association advocacy, on the evening of March 30, 2020, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released an <a href="https://www.cms.gov/files/document/covid-final-ifc.pdf" target="_blank">interim final rule</a> (and <a href="https://www.cms.gov/files/document/covid-19-physicians-and-practitioners.pdf" target="_blank">fact sheet</a>) temporarily expanding <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-General-Information/Telehealth/Telehealth-Codes">the list of covered telehealth services</a> and providing regulatory waivers to help hospitals and physician practices respond to the 2019 Novel Coronavirus pandemic. The new services and waivers are intended to help facilitate telehealth visits with Medicare beneficiaries, including permitting physicians to provide certain services by telephone to new or established patients using CPT codes 98966-98968; 99441-99443.
</p>
<p>
For the duration of the public health emergency, telehealth services will be reimbursed at the same rate as a face-to-face visit. To implement this change, CMS instructs physicians to bill for Medicare telehealth services to report the POS code that would have been reported had the service been furnished in person and use modifier 95. These changes are effective retroactively &ndash; starting March 1, 2020.
</p>
<h3>Commercial insurers</h3>
<p>
The Washington State Office of the Insurance Commissioner issued an <a href="https://www.insurance.wa.gov/sites/default/files/documents/emergency-order-number-20-01.pdf" target="_blank">emergency order</a> on March 5, 2020, indicating that a carrier cannot deny telehealth reimbursement for use of a non-traditionally HIPAA-compliant platform.
</p>
<h3>L&amp;I</h3>
<p>
The Washington State Department of Labor and Industries has announced <a href="https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/WADLI/bulletins/2805799">a temporary telehealth policy</a>. This policy will allow physicians and health care providers to treat injured workers from their homes with the goal of supporting the containment of COVID-19. <a href="https://www.lni.wa.gov/patient-care/billing-payments/marfsdocs/2019/200309temporarytelehealthpolicy.pdf" target="_blank">Read the policy in full</a>.

<p>Medicare continues to announce flexibilities and expand telehealth coverage in response to COVID-19. This applies to traditional Medicare only.</p>
<p>Congress's first major COVID-19 response package granted the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services the authority to waive some restrictions for telehealth services for Medicare beneficiaries.</p>
<p>On March 17, CMS exercised that authority and allowed providers to bill Medicare fee-for-service for patient care, retroactively beginning March 6, in all areas of the country and in all settings, including the beneficiary's home, via three main types of virtual services: telehealth visits, virtual check-ins, and e-visits.</p>
<p>On March 30, CMS issued a second waiver pursuant to the new authority granted under the CARES Act that allows for more than 80 additional services to be provided via telehealth.</p>
<p>Together, these waivers allow:</p>
<h3>Telehealth visits</h3>
<p>
Same as in-person and paid at the same rate as regular, in-person visits.
</p>

<ol>
<li>Provider must use an "interactive audio <strong>and</strong> video telecommunications system that permits real-time communication between the distant site and the patient at home." The HHS Office for Civil Rights also allows physicians to use non-HIPAA compliant telehealth for the duration of the COVID-19 emergency, thus allowing the use of popular applications that allow for video chats, such as including Apple FaceTime, Facebook Messenger video chat, Google Hangouts video, or Skype.</li>
<li>Telehealth visits are available to new and established patients. HHS will not conduct audits to ensure that a patient had a prior established relationship with the practitioner for claims submitted during this public health emergency.</li>
<li>When billing for traditional Medicare telehealth services and non-traditional Medicare telehealth services (i.e., one of newly allowed telehealth codes) with dates of services on or after March 1, 2020, and for the duration of the public health emergency, bill with the place of service (POS) equal to what would have been used if the service had been furnished in-person, along with modifier 95, indicating that the service rendered was actually performed via telehealth. This change will enable physicians to be reimbursed at the same rate as services provided in person. <a href="https://www.cms.gov/outreach-and-educationoutreachffsprovpartprogprovider-partnership-email-archive/2020-04-03-mlnc-se">See this</a> for more information.</li>
<li>Claims do not require "DR" condition code or "CR" modifier.</li>
<li>Telehealth services provided via real-time interactive audio and video should be billed with the POS code that would have been used had the service been provided in person, such as POS=11 (private practice) instead of 02 (telehealth).</li>
<li>A complete list of all Medicare telehealth services can be found <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-General-Information/Telehealth/Telehealth-Codes">on the CMS website</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Virtual check-ins</h3>
<p>
Patient-initiated communications with a physician or other health care provider who can bill for E&amp;M services to determine whether an office visit or other service is needed.
</p>
<ol>
<li>The physician can provide virtual check-in services to both new and established patients.</li>
<li>Communication should not be related to a medical visit within the previous seven days nor lead to a medical visit within the next 24 hours (or soonest appointment available).</li>
<li>Virtual check-ins can be conducted with a broader range of communication methods, unlike Medicare telehealth visits, which require audio and visual capabilities for real-time communication. Use of traditional telephone or cell phone calls for virtual check-ins is acceptable.</li>
<li>No geographic restrictions for patient location.</li>
<li>Providers can bill for these brief (5-10 minute) communications with HCPCS code G2012. (See CPT book for complete details.)</li>
<li>Separate from these virtual check-in services, captured video or images can be sent to a physician for remote evaluation using HCPCS code G2010. (See CPT book for complete details.)</li>
</ol>
<h3>E-visits</h3>
<p>
Non-face-to-face, patient-initiated digital E&amp;M service, i.e., via online patient portal.
</p>
<ol>
<li>The physician or health care provider must have an established relationship with the patient.</li>
<li>Communication can be done synchronously and asynchronously and audio/video phone can be used (but not traditional telephone). These services are not for the non-evaluative electronic communication of test results, scheduling of appointments, or other communication that does not include E/M. </li>
<li>Patient must generate the initial inquiry and communications can occur over a seven-day period. If the patient presents a new, unrelated problem during the seven-day period of an online digital E/M service, then the time is added to the cumulative service time for that seven-day period.</li>
<li>The services may be billed using CPT codes 99421-99423 and HCPCS codes G2061-G2063 as applicable. Service time must be more than 5 minutes. (See Medicare FAQ below and CPT book complete details.)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Telephone services</h3>
<p>
Audio-only with no video connection E&amp;M service provided by a physician.
</p>

<ol>
<li>Physicians and health care providers can now provide certain services to patients by telephone.</li>
<li>These services are available for new and established patients.</li>
<li>Communication should not be related to a medical visit within the previous seven days nor lead to a medical visit within the next 24 hours (or soonest appointment available).</li>
<li>The services may be billed using CPT codes 99441-99443. Service time must be more than five minutes. Use your normal POS. (See CPT book for complete details.)</li>
<li>These are time-based codes so it is important to note the amount of time spent on the telephone with the patient. The CMS interim final rule from 3/31 indicates that these codes are covered and can be billed retroactively from March 1, 2020.</li>
</ol>
<p>The blanket waiver also provides for flexibilities related to workforce, management, enrollment, Stark Law, and appeals, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>Increases in how many times per day or per month certain telehealth codes may be used.</li>
<li>Allowing remote patient monitoring care management codes to apply to additional scenarios without multiple disease diagnoses.</li>
<li>Allowing providers to waive Medicare copayments for telehealth services for beneficiaries in Original Medicare.</li>
</ol>

<h3>HIPAA</h3>
<p>
The Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights (OCR) announced that it is relaxing HIPAA rules for health care providers using telehealth in response to COVID-19. This change is effective immediately. According to OCR, the agency "&hellip;will waive potential HIPAA penalties for good faith use of telehealth during the nationwide public health emergency due to COVID-19." Under this notice:
</p>
<p>
A covered health care provider that wants to use audio or video communication technology to provide telehealth to patients during the COVID-19 nationwide public health emergency <strong>can use any non-public facing remote communication product that is available to communicate with patients.</strong> This includes Apple FaceTime, Facebook Messenger video chat, Google Hangouts video, or Skype, to provide telehealth without risk that OCR might seek to impose a penalty for noncompliance with the HIPAA Rules related to the good faith provision of telehealth during the COVID-19 nationwide public health emergency.
