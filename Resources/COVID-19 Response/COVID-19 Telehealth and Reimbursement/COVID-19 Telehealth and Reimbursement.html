<h1 class="mobileShow">COVID-19 Telehealth and Reimbursement</h1>
<p>During the COVID-19 crisis, sensible telehealth and reimbursement policies are essential to allow physicians and practices to continue providing preventive, acute, and chronic care for their patients, to provide care in a manner that keeps our health care workforce safe, and to protect physician practice viability. </p>
<h2>Adopting Telehealth as COVID-19 Response</h2>
<!-- Content Below -->
<p>Larger practices and systems currently using telehealth technology are working to scale up those services as demand for COVID-19 testing increases. Smaller and midsized physician practices may want to consider adopting telehealth, which is <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/preparing-communities.html">recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> to help mitigate the impact and prevent the spread of COVID-19. Telehealth can:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Enable people to access care and initial screenings from their home.</li>
    <li>Minimize the demands on in-person primary care offices, urgent care centers, and emergency departments.</li>
    <li>Minimize the use of personal protective equipment like gloves and masks.</li>
    <li>Reduce the risk of exposure to patients and medical care teams.</li>
    <li>Ensure that treatment is available for high-need patients.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Setting up telehealth at your practice</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.wsha.org/policy-advocacy/issues/telemedicine/washington-state-telemedicine-collaborative">Washington State Telehealth Collaborative</a> provides a forum for collaboration and sharing of resources to help increase public awareness of telehealth.
