<h2>Adopting Telehealth as COVID-19 Response</h2>
<!-- Content Below -->
<p>Larger practices and systems currently using telehealth technology are working to scale up those services as the novel coronavirus spreads in our communities. The WSMA encourages smaller and midsized physician practices to move routine care and chronic care management to telehealth, which is <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/preparing-communities.html">recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a> to help mitigate the impact and prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus and COVID-19. Telehealth can:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Enable people to access care and initial screenings from their home.</li>
    <li>Minimize the demands on in-person primary care offices, urgent care centers, and emergency departments.</li>
    <li>Minimize the use of personal protective equipment like gloves and masks.</li>
    <li>Reduce the risk of exposure to patients and medical care teams.</li>
    <li>Ensure that treatment is available for high-need patients.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wsha.org/policy-advocacy/issues/telemedicine/washington-state-telemedicine-collaborative">Washington State Telehealth Collaborative</a> provides a forum for collaboration and sharing of resources to help increase public awareness of telehealth. The collaborative offers a <a href="http://www.wsha.org/wp-content/uploads/Frequently-Asked-Questions-about-Telehealth-for-Providers-Dec-2018.pdf" target="_blank">clinician's FAQ guide to telehealth</a> and a <a href="https://www.wsha.org/policy-advocacy/issues/telemedicine/washington-state-telemedicine-collaborative/telemedicine-resources/">list of telehealth resources</a>.</p>
<p>The WSMA is advocating for payment parity for delivering telemedicine services. Learn more about our telehealth advocacy efforts and find breaking telehealth developments <a href="#updates">below</a>.</p>

<h2>Telehealth and HIPAA</h2>

<h2>Telehealth Reimbursement</h2>
<p>Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee has <a href="[@]Shared_Content/News/Membership_Memo/20200326/governor_announces_telehealth_payment_parity_in_response_to_coronavirus_outbreak">implemented Senate Bill 5385 effective immediately</a>, requiring state-regulated insurance carriers to reimburse telemedicine services on par with what they would reimburse for covered services delivered in person.</p>
<p>Washington state Office of the Insurance Commissioner issued <a href="https://www.insurance.wa.gov/sites/default/files/documents/emergency-order-20-02_3.pdf?utm_content=&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_name=&amp;utm_source=govdelivery&amp;utm_term=">an emergency order on Tuesday</a> extending the parity provisions of SB 5385 to include telephone consultations.</p>
<p>The Washington State Health Care Authority similarly <a href="https://www.hca.wa.gov/health-care-services-and-supports/hca-supports-increased-telehealth-options-medicaid-clients-public">issued telehealth payment parity, including telephone visits, for our state's Medicaid and state employee plans</a> on Monday, March 24.</p>
<p>The WSMA thanks Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee, Health Care Authority Director Sue Birch, and Insurance Commissioner Mike Kreidler for their actions to ensure fair reimbursement for services that are delivered via telemedicine. Read our <a href="javascript://[Uploaded files/Resources/COVID19/wsma_telemedicine_parity_thank_you_letter.pdf]">thank you letter</a>, delivered March 26.</p>
<p>Medicare has also <a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/medicare-telemedicine-health-care-provider-fact-sheet">announced payment parity for most telemedicine services</a>. The WSMA is reaching out to our Congressional delegation urging them to require telehealth parity policies for ERISA plans that cannot be regulated by the state—including for telephone visits.</p>

<p><strong>From the AMA:</strong></p>
