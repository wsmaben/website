<p>
Physicians are trained to put patients first, but we can't ignore that the outbreak of the novel coronavirus will impact the profession immensely. Many of our physicians are risking their health and the health or their families, and all pf Washington's physicians are being impacted by the economic fallout of this disease as we stop elective and non-emergent procedures and move to telehealth or as patients head our advice and stay home.
