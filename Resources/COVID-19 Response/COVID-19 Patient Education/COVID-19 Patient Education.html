<h2>Current COVID-19 testing guidelines</h2>
<p>While the virus has the potential to cause severe illness and pneumonia in some people, about 80% of cases are relatively mild. With our health system’s capacity being sorely tested by this sudden, rapidly evolving outbreak, we continue to work with our health care partners in affected areas as well as our patients to ensure those who are most vulnerable to serious complications are able to receive the care they need.</p>
<p>Patients can play a part in helping the health care community slow the transmission of COVID-19. For a patient who may be feeling symptomatic:</p>
<ul>
 <li>If you’re sick, stay home, minimize contact with others where possible, and take healthy precautions to minimize the spread of infection. If you do not have an underlying medical condition and your symptoms are mild, you do not need to be evaluated in person and do not need to be tested for COVID-19.</li>
 <li>If you develop a high fever or any severe symptoms (such as difficulty breathing), call your primary care physician’s office. These symptoms don’t mean you have COVID-19 or need to be tested for COVID-19—only that you should follow up with your regular physician or health care provider as soon as possible.</li>
 <li>If you have symptoms and were exposed to a confirmed COVID-19 patient, call both your primary care physician and, in King County, the Novel Coronavirus Call Center at 206.477.3977.</li>
 <li>To reduce the risk of accidental exposure, do not go to the emergency room. If you're feeling symptomatic, call your doctor about whether, when, and where you should be evaluated.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Washington State Department of Health encourages clinicians, when considering whether or not to test for COVID-19, to provide patients with the following guidance documents, to communicate how to prevent the spread of infection to other people and to minimize phone calls to your office and to public health.</p>

</ul>
<p>The DOH posted a helpful FAQ online on March 9: <a href="https://medium.com/wadepthealth/covid-19-testing-process-what-you-need-to-know-ad741ed1a806">COVID-19 Testing Process: What You Need to Know</a>.</p>
<h2>Multilingual COVID-19 patient resources</h2>
<p>For our patients who don’t speak English, state and public agencies offer COVID-19 educational resources in multiple languages.</p>

<h2>Washington Health Benefit Exchange reopens enrollment</h2>
<p>In response to the potential spread of COVID-19, the Washington Health Benefit Exchange is offering a limited-time special enrollment period for uninsured individuals.

<h2>WSMA PSA “What your doctor wants you to know about coronavirus”</h2>
<p>The WSMA offers a video public service announcement featuring WSMA President Bill Hirota, MD, on “5 things to know about coronavirus.” The brief video sends a simple message to our patient community that most cases of COVID-19 will be mild, and that until we have greater capacity in our system, testing should be reserved for those at highest risk for complications. The WSMA has posted the PSA on its website and its social media channels and encourages members to spread the word.</p>
