<h1 class="mobileShow">Prepare Your Practice for COVID-19</h1>
<p>The WSMA, Washington state officials, and the state's health care community have mobilized in response to an outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and its associated respiratory illness, COVID-19. Read <a href="http://wsma.org/Shared_Content/News/Press_Release/2020/WSMA_Statement_on_COVID-19.aspx">WSMA's statement on the outbreak</a> issued March 6, 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The WSMA is working to make sure you are equipped to handle your patients’ and community needs as the virus spreads. We urge you not to wait, but to prepare your practice now. Review the information below, updated as new details are available. For those of you working in an outpatient practice, please familiarize yourself and your staff with the <a href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/Portals/1/Documents/1600/coronavirus/OutpatientGuidance-COVID19.pdf">Washington State Department of Health’s guidance for outpatient practices</a>.</p>

<p>Larger practices and systems currently using telehealth technology are working to scale up those services as demand for COVID-19 testing increases. Smaller and midsized physician practices may want to consider adopting telehealth, which is <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/preparing-communities.html">recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> to help mitigate the impact and prevent the spread of COVID-19. Telehealth can:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Enable people to access care and initial screenings from their home.</li>
    <li>Minimize the demands on in-person primary care offices, urgent care centers, and emergency departments.</li>
    <li>Minimize the use of personal protective equipment like gloves and masks.</li>
    <li>Reduce the risk of exposure to patients and medical care teams.</li>
    <li>Ensure that treatment is available for high-need patients.</li>

<ul>
    <li>The prescription is issued for a legitimate medical purpose by a practitioner acting in the usual course of his/her professional practice</li>
    <li>
    The telemedicine communication is conducted using an audio-visual, real-time, two-way interactive communication system.</li>
    <li>
    The practitioner is acting in accordance with applicable Federal and State law.</li>

<h3>Telehealth benefits for Medicare beneficiaries expanded
</h3>
<p>
The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services has expanded telehealth coverage for Medicare beneficiaries and will temporarily pay clinicians to provide telehealth services beginning March 6. As COVID-19 poses greater risks to seniors, this will allow Medicare beneficiaries to manage health issues and receive a wider range of services from the comfort and safety of their homes. <a href="https://wsma.org/Shared_Content/News/Membership_Memo/20200318/telehealth_benefits_for_medicare_beneficiaries_expanded">Learn more</a>.

<h3>Other telehealth updates</h3>
<p>
On March 13, 2020, the WSMA wrote to Gov. Inslee urging more flexibility on telehealth so that physicians are able to continue caring for their chronically ill patients. Read the letter in full <a href="javascript://[Uploaded%20files/Resources/COVID19/COVID19%20Gov%20letter%20final2.pdf]" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>The Washington State Legislature has approved <a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=5385&amp;Initiative=false&amp;Year=2019">a bill requiring payment parity for telemedicine.</a> Unfortunately, a key provision of the bill requiring payment parity for commercial plans doesn’t affect plans issued on or after Jan. 1, 2021. However, an emergency clause applies to other portions of the bill making them effective immediately. Medicaid contracts executed after the bill is signed into law will require payment parity for telemedicine services. Additionally, a provision that an in-person visit is required before store and forward is reimbursed is eliminated after the bill is signed into law.</p>
<p>Congress has approved and President Trump has signed a bill appropriating $8.3 billion in emergency funding to combat COVID-19. The bill allocates $500 million to expand telemedicine services for Medicare plans. Additionally, the Trump administration <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-coronavirus-briefing-health-insurers/">announced</a> that a number of major insurance carriers (Blue Cross Blue Shield, Anthem, Humana and UnitedHealthcare) have agreed to provide coverage for telemedicine services, as well as waiving copays and extending coverage, for COVID-19 patients.</p>
<p>America’s Health Insurance Plans has compiled <a href="https://www.ahip.org/health-insurance-providers-respond-to-coronavirus-covid-19/">this list of individual insurance carriers’ response to the COVID-19 outbreak</a>. While not all carriers operate in Washington state, the list details which are now offering telemedicine reimbursement and waivers for COVID-19-related treatment.</p>
<p>Medicare has created <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/medicare-coronavirus">this website</a> to answer COVID-19-related questions.</p>
<p>The Washington State Department of Labor and Industries (L&amp;I) has issued <a href="https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/WADLI/bulletins/2805799">a temporary telehealth policy</a>. This policy will allow physicians and health care providers to treat injured workers from their homes with the goal of supporting the containment of COVID-19. While the policy will reimburse for telemedicine services, it will not provide or reimburse the patient for equipment necessary to receive the telemedicine services. If a worker does not have access to the necessary technology, a provider must work with the patient to find an alternative. This change is effective now through July 3, 2020 unless an extension is necessary.</p>

<h3>OIC waives copays, deductibles, and preauthorizations for COVID-19 testing</h3>
<p>Insurance Commissioner Mike Kreidler <a href="https://www.insurance.wa.gov/news/kreidler-orders-washington-health-insurers-waive-deductibles-and-copays-coronavirus-testing">announced an emergency order</a> to Washington state health insurers requiring them to waive copays and deductibles for any consumer requiring testing for COVID-19. The EO also requires that insurers regulated by the OIC must: allow a one-time early refill for prescription drugs; suspend prior authorization requirements for treatment or testing of COVID-19; and, if an insurer does not have enough medical providers in its network to provide testing and treatment for COVID-19, it must allow enrollees to be treated by another provider within a reasonable distance at no additional cost. The order is effective immediately and applies to all state-regulated health insurance plans and short-term limited duration medical plans until May 4, 2020.

<p>According to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/clinical-criteria.html">CDC clinical guidance updated March 4</a>, clinicians should use their judgment to determine if a patient has signs and symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and whether the patient should be tested. Decisions on which patients receive testing should be based on the local epidemiology of COVID-19, as well as the clinical course of illness. Most patients with confirmed COVID-19 have developed fever and/or symptoms of acute respiratory illness (e.g., cough, difficulty breathing). Clinicians are strongly encouraged to test for other causes of respiratory illness, including infections such as influenza.</p>
<p>The following patients with COVID-19 symptoms are considered at highest priority for testing:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Health care workers.</li>
    <li>Patients in other public safety occupations (e.g., law enforcement, fire fighter, EMS).</li>
    <li>Patients involved in an illness cluster in a facility or institution (e.g., health care, school, corrections, shelters).</li>
    <li>Patients with severe lower respiratory illness (hospitalized or fatal).</li>
    <li>Patients with worsening symptoms.</li>
    <li>Patients older than 60 years.</li>
    <li>Patients with underlying medical conditions.</li>
    <li>Pregnant women.</li>
    <li>Any other patients can be tested per physician and health care provider judgment.</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, the Washington State Department of Health does not recommend testing asymptomatic persons. However, you can consider testing asymptomatic persons if they have been in close contact with a confirmed case. A negative test result does not rule out an infection.</p>

<h3>Washington State Department of Health COVID-19 testing guidance</h3>
<p><em>Updated March 17, 2020</em></p>
<p>
Physicians and health care providers should send specimens for COVID-19 testing to <a href="https://www.labcorp.com/tests/139900/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-naa">LabCorp</a>, <a href="https://www.questdiagnostics.com/home/Covid-19/">Quest Diagnostics</a> and other commercial laboratories doing testing.</p>
<p>Until the <a href="https://depts.washington.edu/uwviro/">UW Medicine Virology Laboratory </a> has more testing capacity readily available, they are prioritizing specimens from hospitalized patients, health care workers and first responders.</p>
<p>Limited testing is available from the Washington's public health laboratories. Public health labs are accepting specimens from health care workers, patients in other public safety occupations (e.g., law enforcement, fire fighter, EMS), patients involved in an illness cluster in a facility or group (e.g., health care, school, corrections, business), and patients with no health insurance. If seeking testing at PHL, call your <a href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/AboutUs/PublicHealthSystem/LocalHealthJurisdictions">local health jurisdiction</a> to discuss the case. If possible, please call 8 a.m.–4:30 p.m. </p>
<p>Read DOH's full guidance: <a href="javascript://[Uploaded files/Resources/COVID19/Interim-2019NovelCoronavirusQuicksheetProviders_March17.pdf]">COVID-19 testing information for health care providers</a>  - updated March 17, 2020.</p>
<h3>CDC COVID-19 testing guidance</h3>
<p>As availability of diagnostic testing for COVID-19 increases, clinicians will be able to access laboratory tests for diagnosing COVID-19 through clinical laboratories performing tests authorized by FDA under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). Clinicians should consult with the laboratories that routinely perform their diagnostic services to see how best to access testing for COVID-19. The FDA offers a <a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/emergency-use-authorizations#coronavirus2019">list of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Emergency Use Authorizations </a>provided by the agency.</p>

<p>In the face of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Washington Healthcare Forum Work Group, made up of leading health care organizations in Washington state, including the WSMA, are working together to create a common set of high-level recommendations that individual organizations will use to develop their own individual policies and procedures related to the protection of their employees and patients.</p>
<p>The first two consensus recommendations address infection prevention and control precautions and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and management of health care personnel with potential exposure to COVID-19.</p>
<ol style="margin-left: 40px;">
    <li>Health care organizations will implement policies and procedures consistent with the <a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-rights-roles-respon-hw-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=bcabd401_0">World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for infection prevention and control during health care when a novel coronavirus (nCoV) infection is suspected</a>, as endorsed by the Washington State Department of Health.</li>
    <li>Health care organizations will implement policies and procedures based on the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-risk-assesment-hcp.html">CDC’s Interim U.S. Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Healthcare Personnel with Potential Exposure in a Healthcare Setting to Patients with Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)</a>, including the consideration to allow asymptomatic health care personnel who have had an exposure to a COVID-19 patient to continue to work with daily symptom monitoring in consultation with their employee health services.</li>
</ol>
<p>Download the Washington Healthcare Forum Work Group’s <a href="https://wsma.org/doc_library/news/consensus_position_protection_030820_wsma_wsha.pdf">Consensus Recommendations for the Protection of Health Care Personnel and Patients Related to COVID-19</a> (March 8, 2020).</p>
<p>The next set of consensus recommendations relates to collection of nasopharyngeal (NP) or oropharyngeal (OP) swabs. COVID-19 is an emerging disease and our knowledge about the natural history, transmission, clinical course and treatment is constantly updated. When the CDC announced isolation precautions with associated recommendations for personal protective equipment, they differed from the World Health Organization by recommending airborne and contact precautions due to this being a new virus. The WHO has continued to recommend droplet and contact precautions, based on SARS-CoV-2 being primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets, reserving airborne precautions for those patients undergoing aerosol-generating procedures. Washington state led the change to adopt the WHO guidelines and now Oregon has followed. Similar CDC changes are expected soon.</p>
<h4>Aerosol-generating procedures</h4>
<p>A list of aerosol-generating procedures that would still require airborne precautions follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Intubation, extubation and related procedures such as manual ventilation and open suctioning.</li>
    <li>Tracheotomy and tracheostomy procedures (insertion, open suctioning, removal).</li>
    <li>Bronchoscopy.</li>
    <li>Surgery and post-mortem procedures involving high-speed devices.</li>
    <li>Some dental procedures (such as high-speed drilling).</li>
    <li>Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) such as bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) and continuous positive airway pressure ventilation (CPAP).</li>
    <li>High-frequency oscillating ventilation (HFOV).</li>
    <li>High-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO), also called high-flow nasal cannula.</li>
    <li>Induction of sputum.</li>
    <li>Medication administration via continuous nebulizer.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mechanical ventilation</span> – judged on a case-by-case basis by the ICU attending with infectious disease and/or infection prevention</p>
<ul>
    <li>As long as the ICU ventilator circuit has a filter in place and the circuit remains closed, airborne precautions are not needed.</li>
    <li>If patient care requires, or is at risk for, frequent breaks in the circuit, airborne precautions should be used.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Collection of nasopharyngeal (NP) or oropharyngeal (OP) swabs</h4>
<p>Outpatient collection of NP or OP swabs is not considered an aerosol generating procedure. This was determined in conjunction with Infectious Disease and Infection Prevention providers from around the region.</p>
<p>Providers collecting such samples should use droplet and contact precautions with mask, eye protection, gown and gloves. Collecting nasopharyngeal swabs should be done correctly to maximize the sensitivity and specificity of the test result; and staff education will be provided.</p>
<p>Severely ill patients requiring hospitalization should have testing deferred prior to transfer. Inpatient collection of NP or OP swabs for critically ill or highly symptomatic patients may still require the addition of airborne precautions. The attending physician in conjunction with ID or Infection Prevention can assist with this determination.</p>
<p>The Work Group will continue to update these recommendations as new information becomes available and will be developing future recommendations to further align and coordinate our collective response.</p>

<p>While the virus has the potential to cause severe illness and pneumonia in some people, about 80% of cases are relatively mild. With our health system’s capacity being sorely tested by this sudden, rapidly evolving outbreak, we continue to work with our health care partners in affected areas as well as our patients to ensure those who are most vulnerable to serious complications are able to receive the care they need.</p>
<p>Patients can play a part in helping the health care community slow the transmission of COVID-19. For a patient who may be feeling symptomatic:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If you’re sick, stay home, minimize contact with others where possible, and take healthy precautions to minimize the spread of infection. If you do not have an underlying medical condition and your symptoms are mild, you do not need to be evaluated in person and do not need to be tested for COVID-19.</li>
    <li>If you develop a high fever or any severe symptoms (such as difficulty breathing), call your primary care physician’s office. These symptoms don’t mean you have COVID-19 or need to be tested for COVID-19—only that you should follow up with your regular physician or health care provider as soon as possible.</li>
    <li>If you have symptoms and were exposed to a confirmed COVID-19 patient, call both your primary care physician and, in King County, the Novel Coronavirus Call Center at 206.477.3977.</li>
    <li>To reduce the risk of accidental exposure, do not go to the emergency room. If you're feeling symptomatic, call your doctor about whether, when, and where you should be evaluated.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Washington State Department of Health encourages clinicians, when considering whether or not to test for COVID-19, to provide patients with the following guidance documents, to communicate how to prevent the spread of infection to other people and to minimize phone calls to your office and to public health.</p>

<p>The DOH posted a helpful FAQ online on March 9: <a href="https://medium.com/wadepthealth/covid-19-testing-process-what-you-need-to-know-ad741ed1a806">COVID-19 Testing Process: What You Need to Know</a>.</p>
<h3>Multilingual COVID-19 patient resources</h3>
<p>For our patients who don’t speak English, state and public agencies offer COVID-19 educational resources in multiple languages.</p>

<h3>WSMA PSA “What your doctor wants you to know about coronavirus”</h3>
<p>The WSMA offers a video public service announcement featuring WSMA President Bill Hirota, MD, on “5 things to know about coronavirus.” The brief video sends a simple message to our patient community that most cases of COVID-19 will be mild, and that until we have greater capacity in our system, testing should be reserved for those at highest risk for complications. The WSMA has posted the PSA on its website and its social media channels and encourages members to spread the word.</p>

From the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Responding to COVID-19 can take an emotional toll on you. There are things you can do to reduce secondary traumatic stress (STS) reactions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Acknowledge that STS can impact anyone helping families after a traumatic event.
    </li>
    <li>Learn the symptoms including physical (fatigue, illness) and mental (fear, withdrawal, guilt).
    </li>
    <li>Allow time for you and your family to recover from responding to the outbreak.
    </li>
    <li>Create a menu of personal self-care activities that you enjoy, such as spending time with friends and family, exercising, or reading a book.
    </li>
    <li>Take a break from media coverage of COVID-19.
    </li>
    <li>Ask for help if you feel overwhelmed or concerned that COVID-19 is affecting your ability to care for your family and patients as you did before the outbreak.

<p>As Washington takes <a href="https://medium.com/wagovernor/inslee-issues-emergency-proclamation-that-limits-large-events-to-minimize-public-health-risk-38b4d79a563d">more steps to reduce the spread of COVID-19</a>, the Washington State Department of Health will now enroll and activate emergency volunteer health practitioners in preparation for health system requests and surging. This will help the state meet emerging demands for health care workers.</p>
<p>The DOH can perform this work under the authority of the Uniform Emergency Volunteer Health Practitioner Act (<a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70.15">chapter 70.15</a> RCW), if an <a href="https://www.governor.wa.gov/news-media/inslee-issues-covid-19-emergency-proclamation">emergency proclamation by the governor</a> is in effect - as is the case in Washington as of Feb. 29, 2020.</p>
<p>If volunteers are registered in the volunteer health practitioner system and verified to be in good standing in all states where they are licensed, they may practice in Washington without obtaining a Washington license once activated and assigned by DOH.</p>
<p>In-state practitioners can become volunteers in two ways:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Via RCW <a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70.15">chapter 70.15</a> by registering and completing the Emergency Volunteer Health Practitioners Application which can be found<a href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/Portals/1/Documents/1600/coronavirus/EmergencyHealthcarePractitionersVolunteerApplication.DOCX"> here</a>.</li>
    <li>Via registering with their local Medical Reserve Corps; more information can be found at: <a href="https://mrc.hhs.gov/">https://mrc.hhs.gov</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Out-of-state practitioners may:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Become volunteers via RCW <a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70.15">chapter 70.15</a> by registering and completing the Emergency Volunteer Health Practitioners Application which can be found <a href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/Portals/1/Documents/1600/coronavirus/EmergencyHealthcarePractitionersVolunteerApplication.DOCX">here</a>.</li>
    <li>Out of state MDs and DOs who would like an expedited Washington license and to volunteer, may use the <a href="https://imlcc.org/">Interstate Medical License Compact</a> and become <a href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/NovelCoronavirusOutbreak2020/HealthcareProviders/EmergencyVolunteerHealthPractitioners">registered under RCW 70.15</a>. At this time, we are limiting our request for health care practitioners to U.S. jurisdictions due to technical issues. We may expand the call to international jurisdictions in the future as needs arise.</li>
</ul>
<p>Applications will be screened by the DOH to ensure the potential volunteer’s health license is in good standing in each state they where they are licensed. The DOH will activate, deploy and deactivate approved volunteer health practitioners as needs are identified and requested. Please share this urgent request broadly with other organizations, national groups, stakeholders, followers, and readers.</p>
