<h2>Adopting Telehealth as COVID-19 Response</h2>
<!-- Content Below -->
<p>Larger practices and systems currently using telehealth technology are working to scale up those services as demand for COVID-19 testing increases. Smaller and midsized physician practices may want to consider adopting telehealth, which is <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/preparing-communities.html">recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> to help mitigate the impact and prevent the spread of COVID-19. Telehealth can:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Enable people to access care and initial screenings from their home.</li>
 <li>Minimize the demands on in-person primary care offices, urgent care centers, and emergency departments.</li>
 <li>Minimize the use of personal protective equipment like gloves and masks.</li>
 <li>Reduce the risk of exposure to patients and medical care teams.</li>
 <li>Ensure that treatment is available for high-need patients.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Telehealth benefits for Medicare beneficiaries expanded
</h3>
<p>
The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services has expanded telehealth coverage for Medicare beneficiaries and will temporarily pay clinicians to provide telehealth services beginning March 6.

<h3>Other telehealth updates</h3>
<p>
On March 13, 2020, the WSMA wrote to Gov. Inslee urging more flexibility on telehealth so that physicians are able to continue caring for their chronically ill patients. Read the letter in full <a href="javascript://[Uploaded%20files/Resources/COVID19/COVID19%20Gov%20letter%20final2.pdf]">here</a>.</p>
<p>The Washington State Legislature has approved <a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=5385&amp;Initiative=false&amp;Year=2019">a bill requiring payment parity for telemedicine.</a> Unfortunately, a key provision of the bill requiring payment parity for commercial plans doesn’t affect plans issued on or after Jan. 1, 2021. However, an emergency clause applies to other portions of the bill making them effective immediately. Medicaid contracts executed after the bill is signed into law will require payment parity for telemedicine services. Additionally, a provision that an in-person visit is required before store and forward is reimbursed is eliminated after the bill is signed into law.</p>
<p>Congress has approved and President Trump has signed a bill appropriating $8.3 billion in emergency funding to combat COVID-19. The bill allocates $500 million to expand telemedicine services for Medicare plans. Additionally, the Trump administration <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-coronavirus-briefing-health-insurers/">announced</a> that a number of major insurance carriers (Blue Cross Blue Shield, Anthem, Humana and UnitedHealthcare) have agreed to provide coverage for telemedicine services, as well as waiving copays and extending coverage, for COVID-19 patients.</p>
<p>America’s Health Insurance Plans has compiled <a href="https://www.ahip.org/health-insurance-providers-respond-to-coronavirus-covid-19/">this list of individual insurance carriers’ response to the COVID-19 outbreak</a>. While not all carriers operate in Washington state, the list details which are now offering telemedicine reimbursement and waivers for COVID-19-related treatment.</p>
<p>Medicare has created <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/medicare-coronavirus">this website</a> to answer COVID-19-related questions.</p>
<p>The Washington State Department of Labor and Industries (L&amp;I) has issued <a href="https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/WADLI/bulletins/2805799">a temporary telehealth policy</a>. This policy will allow physicians and health care providers to treat injured workers from their homes with the goal of supporting the containment of COVID-19. While the policy will reimburse for telemedicine services, it will not provide or reimburse the patient for equipment necessary to receive the telemedicine services. If a worker does not have access to the necessary technology, a provider must work with the patient to find an alternative. This change is effective now through July 3, 2020 unless an extension is necessary.</p>

<h3>OIC waives copays, deductibles, and preauthorizations for COVID-19 testing</h3>
<p>Insurance Commissioner Mike Kreidler <a href="https://www.insurance.wa.gov/news/kreidler-orders-washington-health-insurers-waive-deductibles-and-copays-coronavirus-testing">announced an emergency order</a> to Washington state health insurers requiring them to waive copays and deductibles for any consumer requiring testing for COVID-19. The EO also requires that insurers regulated by the OIC must: allow a one-time early refill for prescription drugs; suspend prior authorization requirements for treatment or testing of COVID-19; and, if an insurer does not have enough medical providers in its network to provide testing and treatment for COVID-19, it must allow enrollees to be treated by another provider within a reasonable distance at no additional cost. The order is effective immediately and applies to all state-regulated health insurance plans and short-term limited duration medical plans until May 4, 2020.
