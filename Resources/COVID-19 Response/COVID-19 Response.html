<p>
The WSMA, Washington state officials, and the state's health care community have mobilized in response to an outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and its associated respiratory illness, COVID-19.</p>
<!--ContentHere
<h3>What to do if feeling symptomatic</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
    If you're sick, stay home, minimize contact with others where possible, and take the precautions listed below (under "Protecting yourself and others") for minimizing the spread of potential viral infections. Most people with mild coronavirus illness will recover on their own by staying home, drinking plenty of fluids, resting, and taking pain and fever medications. If you do not have an underlying medical condition and your symptoms are mild, you do not need to be evaluated in person and do not need to be tested for COVID-19.
    </li>
    <li>
    If you develop a high fever or any severe symptoms (such as difficulty breathing), contact your primary care physician or provider. These symptoms don't mean you have COVID-19 or need to be tested for COVID-19&mdash;only that you should follow up with your regular physician or health provider as soon as possible. Your doctor can work with you to determine the best course for your care, individualized to your needs and symptoms. If you don't have a doctor, call your local nurse line or the Washington State Department of Health coronavirus hotline at 1.800.525.0127, press # for symptom evaluation (the hotline is experiencing high traffic and may be temporarily unavailable).
    </li>
    <li>
    If you have symptoms and were exposed to a confirmed COVID-19 patient, call both your primary care physician and, in King County, the Novel Coronavirus Call Center, 206.477.3977.
    </li>
    <li>
    To reduce the risk of accidental exposure, do not go to the emergency room. If you're feeling symptomatic, call your doctor about whether, when and where you should be evaluated.
    </li>
    <li>If you are older and/or have an underlying medical condition, carefully review the Washington State Department of Health's <a href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/NovelCoronavirusOutbreak2020/HigherRiskforSeriousIllness">Guidance for Persons Who are at Higher Risk for Serious Illness</a>
    </li>
</ul>
<p class="AsiWarning">Important: If you're sick, you don't necessarily need to be tested; as testing becomes more widely available, it's important that those at highest risk for health complications are able to receive needed testing. Review the above information for further guidance.</p>
<h3>Protecting yourself and others</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Everyone is advised to take the following precautions to reduce their risk of getting and spreading any viral respiratory infections:
    <ul>
        <li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.
        </li>
        <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
        </li>
        <li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
        </li>
        <li>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, then throw the tissue in the trash and wash your hands.
        </li>
        <li>Clean and disinfect objects and surfaces.
        </li>
<li>Don't rush out and buy a mask&mdash;masks are not effective for preventing the spread of the virus in most settings, and should be reserved for use by health professionals and facilities. If health care providers can't access the masks to care for sick patients, it could put them and their communities at risk.
 </li>
        <li>Stay at home and away from others if you are feeling ill.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
