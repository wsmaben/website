<p class="AsiWarning"><strong>TOP UPDATES:</strong><br />
The WSMA and over 20 state specialty and county medical societies support Gov. Jay Inslee’s proclamation prohibiting all hospitals, ambulatory surgery facilities, dental, orthodontic and endodontic offices in Washington state from providing health care services, procedures, and surgeries that, if delayed, are not anticipated to cause harm to the patient within the next three months, with some exceptions. Read <a href="[@]Shared_Content/News/Press_Release/2020/the_wsma_state_specialty_and_county_societies_support_gov_inslees_decision_on_elective_surgeries.aspx">WSMA’s press release</a>.<br />
<br />
We know testing supplies and protective personal equipment (PPE) are in limited supply. As the WSMA learns more about availability in our state, we will let you know. For now, a tiering system is set up to get supplies to settings treating COVID-19 patients. See <a href="javascript://[Uploaded files/Resources/COVID19/PPE_prioritization_DOH_3-11-20.pdf]">this DOH guidance document from March 11</a>.
<br />
<br />
The WSMA has heard from state officials that each local health district is setting up plans for child care for health care workers. As those plans become available, we will share those details.
<br />
<br />
On March 13, 2020, the WSMA delivered&nbsp;<a href="javascript://[Uploaded%20files/Resources/COVID19/COVID19%20Gov%20letter%20final2.pdf]">a letter</a>, cosigned by more than 25 other state and specialty societies, to Washington Gov. Jay Inslee urging him to expand social distancing limitations to restrict gatherings of 50 or more. We thank the governor for his subsequent announcement to close restaurants and bars statewide and limit gatherings of 50 or more people.
<br />
<br />
In our <a href="javascript://[Uploaded%20files/Resources/COVID19/COVID19%20Gov%20letter%20final2.pdf]">March 13 letter to Gov. Inslee</a>, the WSMA, on behalf of the signatories, urged more flexibility on telehealth, so that physicians are able to continue caring for their chronically ill patients.
<br />
<br />
The WSMA has released five new public service announcement videos, "Is it a cold or COVID-19?, ""What your doctor wants you to know about COVID-19 symptoms," "Your doctor wants you to BLOCK THE DROPS!" "What your doctor wants you to know about your COVID-19 risk," and "Is it a cold or COVID-19?"&nbsp;<a href="#video">Find the videos here.</a>

<h2>Update on COVID-19 Outbreak in Washington State</h2>
<p>This page was updated March 18, 2020, and will be continually updated as new information is available.</p>
<p>
The WSMA, Washington state officials, and the state's health care community have mobilized in response to an outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and its associated respiratory illness, COVID-19. Read <a href="http://wsma.org/Shared_Content/News/Press_Release/2020/WSMA_Statement_on_COVID-19.aspx">WSMA's statement on the outbreak</a> issued March 6, 2020. While the virus has the potential to cause severe illness and pneumonia in some people, about 80% of cases are relatively mild.</p>
<h3>What to do if feeling symptomatic</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
    If you’re sick, stay home, minimize contact with others where possible, and take the precautions listed below (under "Protecting yourself and others") for minimizing the spread of potential viral infections. Most people with mild coronavirus illness will recover on their own by staying home, drinking plenty of fluids, resting, and taking pain and fever medications. If you do not have an underlying medical condition and your symptoms are mild, you do not need to be evaluated in person and do not need to be tested for COVID-19.
    </li>
    <li>
    If you develop a high fever or any severe symptoms (such as difficulty breathing), contact your primary care physician or provider. These symptoms don’t mean you have COVID-19 or need to be tested for COVID-19—only that you should follow up with your regular physician or health provider as soon as possible. Your doctor can work with you to determine the best course for your care, individualized to your needs and symptoms. If you don't have a doctor, call your local nurse line or the Washington State Department of Health coronavirus hotline at 1.800.525.0127, press # for symptom evaluation (the hotline is experiencing high traffic and may be temporarily unavailable).
    </li>
    <li>
    If you have symptoms and were exposed to a confirmed COVID-19 patient, call both your primary care physician and, in King County, the Novel Coronavirus Call Center, 206.477.3977.
    </li>
    <li>
    To reduce the risk of accidental exposure, do not go to the emergency room. If you're feeling symptomatic, call your doctor about whether, when and where you should be evaluated.
    </li>
    <li>If you are older and/or have an underlying medical condition, carefully review the Washington State Department of Health's <a href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/NovelCoronavirusOutbreak2020/HigherRiskforSeriousIllness">Guidance for Persons Who are at Higher Risk for Serious Illness</a>
    </li>
</ul>
<p class="AsiWarning">Important: If you're sick, you don't necessarily need to be tested; as testing becomes more widely available, it's important that those at highest risk for health complications are able to receive needed testing. Review the above information for further guidance.</p>
<h3>Protecting yourself and others</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Everyone is advised to take the following precautions to reduce their risk of getting and spreading any viral respiratory infections:
    <ul>
        <li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.
        </li>
        <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
        </li>
        <li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
        </li>
        <li>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, then throw the tissue in the trash and wash your hands.
        </li>
        <li>Clean and disinfect objects and surfaces.
        </li>
        <!--HIDE<li>Don't rush out and buy a mask—masks are not effective for preventing the spread of the virus in most settings, and should be reserved for use by health professionals and facilities. If health care providers can’t access the masks to care for sick patients, it could put them and their communities at risk.
        </li>-->
        <li>Stay at home and away from others if you are feeling ill.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>

<h2>COVID-19 Emergency Volunteers Needed</h2>
<!-- Content Below -->
<p>As Washington takes <a href="https://medium.com/wagovernor/inslee-issues-emergency-proclamation-that-limits-large-events-to-minimize-public-health-risk-38b4d79a563d">more steps to reduce the spread of COVID-19</a>, the Washington State Department of Health will now enroll and activate emergency volunteer health practitioners in preparation for health system requests and surging. This will help the state meet emerging demands for health care workers.</p>
<p>The DOH can perform this work under the authority of the Uniform Emergency Volunteer Health Practitioner Act (<a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70.15">chapter 70.15</a> RCW), if an <a href="https://www.governor.wa.gov/news-media/inslee-issues-covid-19-emergency-proclamation">emergency proclamation by the governor</a> is in effect - as is the case in Washington as of Feb. 29, 2020.</p>
<p>If volunteers are registered in the volunteer health practitioner system and verified to be in good standing in all states where they are licensed, they may practice in Washington without obtaining a Washington license once activated and assigned by DOH.</p>
<p>In-state practitioners can become volunteers in two ways:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Via RCW <a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70.15">chapter 70.15</a> by registering and completing the Emergency Volunteer Health Practitioners Application which can be found<a href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/Portals/1/Documents/1600/coronavirus/EmergencyHealthcarePractitionersVolunteerApplication.DOCX"> here</a>.</li>
    <li>Via registering with their local Medical Reserve Corps; more information can be found at: <a href="https://mrc.hhs.gov/">https://mrc.hhs.gov</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Out-of-state practitioners may:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Become volunteers via RCW <a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70.15">chapter 70.15</a> by registering and completing the Emergency Volunteer Health Practitioners Application which can be found <a href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/Portals/1/Documents/1600/coronavirus/EmergencyHealthcarePractitionersVolunteerApplication.DOCX">here</a>.</li>
    <li>Out of state MDs and DOs who would like an expedited Washington license and to volunteer, may use the <a href="https://imlcc.org/">Interstate Medical License Compact</a> and become <a href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/NovelCoronavirusOutbreak2020/HealthcareProviders/EmergencyVolunteerHealthPractitioners">registered under RCW 70.15</a>. At this time, we are limiting our request for health care practitioners to U.S. jurisdictions due to technical issues. We may expand the call to international jurisdictions in the future as needs arise.</li>
</ul>
<p>Applications will be screened by the DOH to ensure the potential volunteer’s health license is in good standing in each state they where they are licensed. The DOH will activate, deploy and deactivate approved volunteer health practitioners as needs are identified and requested. Please share this urgent request broadly with other organizations, national groups, stakeholders, followers, and readers.</p>
<p>FAQs about RCW 70.15 are available <a href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/NovelCoronavirusOutbreak2020/HealthcareProviders/EmergencyVolunteerHealthPractitioners">here</a><strong>. </strong>Questions can be emailed to <a href="mailto:WAserv@doh.wa.gov">WAserv@doh.wa.gov</a> or 360.236.4090.</p>
