<p>
During the COVID-19 crisis, sensible telehealth and reimbursement policies are essential to allow physicians and practices to continue providing preventive, acute, and chronic care for their patients, to provide care in a manner that keeps our health care workforce safe, and to protect physician practice viability.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Here's what you need to know to best utilize telehealth in your practice:</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>HIPAA relaxed at the federal level:</strong> The Health and Human Services agency has <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/special-topics/emergency-preparedness/notification-enforcement-discretion-telehealth/index.html">relaxed HIPAA regulations</a> for physicians using telehealth to treat their patients. This change allows for the use of video chat applications (FaceTime, Skype, etc.) to provide telehealth services.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Office of the Insurance Commissioner OKs the use of non-HIPAA compliant platforms including telephone:</strong> The OIC has <a href="https://www.insurance.wa.gov/sites/default/files/documents/emergency-order-20-02_3.pdf?utm_content=&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_name=&amp;utm_source=govdelivery&amp;utm_term=">issued an order</a> requiring all state-regulated carriers to permit and reimburse for care provided over non-HIPAA compliant platforms – including video chat applications and the telephone.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Governor Inslee's proclamation requires payment parity:</strong> The <a href="https://www.insurance.wa.gov/sites/default/files/documents/emergency-order-20-02_3.pdf?utm_content=&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_name=&amp;utm_source=govdelivery&amp;utm_term=">proclamation implements SB 5385</a> – requiring telemedicine services to be paid for at parity with face-to-face services – immediately.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Medicaid also paying at parity:</strong> Medicaid, including MCOs and FFS, are <a href="https://www.hca.wa.gov/health-care-services-and-supports/hca-supports-increased-telehealth-options-medicaid-clients-public">both paying for telehealth</a> – including services administered over the telephone – at parity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Medicare relaxing telehealth requirements:</strong> The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services has <a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/medicare-telemedicine-health-care-provider-fact-sheet">expanded telehealth services</a> and <a href="https://www.cms.gov/files/document/covid-19-physicians-and-practitioners.pdf" target="_blank">waived certain telemedicine regulations</a> for Medicare beneficiaries during the 2019 Novel Coronavirus pandemic.

</p>
<h3>Gov. Inslee's proclamation on payment parity</h3>
<p>
On March 25, Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee issued a <a href="https://www.governor.wa.gov/sites/default/files/proclamations/20-29%20Coronovirus%20OIC%20%28tmp%29.pdf?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery">proclamation</a> that implemented Senate Bill 5385 immediately. Among other provisions, SB 5385 requires carriers to pay for telemedicine services at parity with face-to-face visits. This change applies to all state-regulated plans. However, this change is not applicable to certain self-insured/ERISA plans that are not regulated by the state. Gov. Inslee's proclamation will expire at midnight on April 24, 2020. For the order to be renewed, the governor will need approval from legislative leadership.
</p>

<em>Last updated on April 16, 2020.</em>
</p>

<p>Medicare continues to announce flexibilities and expand telehealth coverage in response to COVID-19. This applies to traditional Medicare only.</p>
<p>Congress's first major COVID-19 response package granted the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services the authority to waive some restrictions for telehealth services for Medicare beneficiaries.</p>
<p>On March 17, CMS exercised that authority and allowed providers to bill Medicare fee-for-service for patient care, retroactively beginning March 6, in all areas of the country and in all settings, including the beneficiary's home, via three main types of virtual services: telehealth visits, virtual check-ins, and e-visits.</p>
<p>On March 30, CMS issued a second waiver pursuant to the new authority granted under the CARES Act that allows for more than 80 additional services to be provided via telehealth.</p>
<p>Together, these waivers allow:</p>
<h3>Telehealth visits</h3>
<p>
Same as in-person and paid at the same rate as regular, in-person visits.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Provider must use an "interactive audio <strong>and</strong> video telecommunications system that permits real-time communication between the distant site and the patient at home." The HHS Office for Civil Rights also allows physicians to use non-HIPAA compliant telehealth for the duration of the COVID-19 emergency, thus allowing the use of popular applications that allow for video chats, such as including Apple FaceTime, Facebook Messenger video chat, Google Hangouts video, or Skype.</li>
    <li>Telehealth visits are available to new and established patients. HHS will not conduct audits to ensure that a patient had a prior established relationship with the practitioner for claims submitted during this public health emergency.</li>
    <li>When billing for traditional Medicare telehealth services and non-traditional Medicare telehealth services (i.e., one of newly allowed telehealth codes) with dates of services on or after March 1, 2020, and for the duration of the public health emergency, bill with the place of service (POS) equal to what would have been used if the service had been furnished in-person, along with modifier 95, indicating that the service rendered was actually performed via telehealth. This change will enable physicians to be reimbursed at the same rate as services provided in person. <a href="https://www.cms.gov/outreach-and-educationoutreachffsprovpartprogprovider-partnership-email-archive/2020-04-03-mlnc-se">See this</a> for more information.</li>
    <li>Claims do not require "DR" condition code or "CR" modifier.</li>
    <li>Telehealth services provided via real-time interactive audio and video should be billed with the POS code that would have been used had the service been provided in person, such as POS=11 (private practice) instead of 02 (telehealth).</li>
    <li>A complete list of all Medicare telehealth services can be found <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-General-Information/Telehealth/Telehealth-Codes">on the CMS website</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Virtual check-ins</h3>
<p>
Patient-initiated communications with a physician or other health care provider who can bill for E&amp;M services to determine whether an office visit or other service is needed.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>The physician can provide virtual check-in services to both new and established patients.</li>
    <li>Communication should not be related to a medical visit within the previous seven days nor lead to a medical visit within the next 24 hours (or soonest appointment available).</li>
    <li>Virtual check-ins can be conducted with a broader range of communication methods, unlike Medicare telehealth visits, which require audio and visual capabilities for real-time communication. Use of traditional telephone or cell phone calls for virtual check-ins is acceptable.</li>
    <li>No geographic restrictions for patient location.</li>
    <li>Providers can bill for these brief (5-10 minute) communications with HCPCS code G2012. (See CPT book for complete details.)</li>
    <li>Separate from these virtual check-in services, captured video or images can be sent to a physician for remote evaluation using HCPCS code G2010. (See CPT book for complete details.)</li>
</ol>
<h3>E-visits</h3>
<p>
Non-face-to-face, patient-initiated digital E&amp;M service, i.e., via online patient portal.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>The physician or health care provider must have an established relationship with the patient.</li>
    <li>Communication can be done synchronously and asynchronously and audio/video phone can be used (but not traditional telephone). These services are not for the non-evaluative electronic communication of test results, scheduling of appointments, or other communication that does not include E/M. </li>
    <li>Patient must generate the initial inquiry and communications can occur over a seven-day period. If the patient presents a new, unrelated problem during the seven-day period of an online digital E/M service, then the time is added to the cumulative service time for that seven-day period.</li>
    <li>The services may be billed using CPT codes 99421-99423 and HCPCS codes G2061-G2063 as applicable. Service time must be more than 5 minutes. (See Medicare FAQ below and CPT book complete details.)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Telephone services</h3>
<p>
Audio-only with no video connection E&amp;M service provided by a physician.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Physicians and health care providers can now provide certain services to patients by telephone.</li>
    <li>These services are available for new and established patients.</li>
    <li>Communication should not be related to a medical visit within the previous seven days nor lead to a medical visit within the next 24 hours (or soonest appointment available).</li>
    <li>The services may be billed using CPT codes 99441-99443. Service time must be more than five minutes. Use your normal POS. (See CPT book for complete details.)</li>
    <li>These are time-based codes so it is important to note the amount of time spent on the telephone with the patient. The CMS interim final rule from 3/31 indicates that these codes are covered and can be billed retroactively from March 1, 2020.</li>
</ol>
<p>The blanket waiver also provides for flexibilities related to workforce, management, enrollment, Stark Law, and appeals, including:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Increases in how many times per day or per month certain telehealth codes may be used.</li>
    <li>Allowing remote patient monitoring care management codes to apply to additional scenarios without multiple disease diagnoses.</li>
    <li>Allowing providers to waive Medicare copayments for telehealth services for beneficiaries in Original Medicare.</li>
