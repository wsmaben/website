During the COVID-19 crisis, sensible telehealth policies are essential to allow physicians and practices to continue providing preventive, acute, and chronic care for their patients, to provide care in a manner that keeps our health care workforce safe, and to protect physician practice viability.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Here's what you need to know to best utilize telehealth in your practice:</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>HIPAA relaxed at the federal level:</strong> The Health and Human Services agency has <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/special-topics/emergency-preparedness/notification-enforcement-discretion-telehealth/index.html">relaxed HIPAA regulations</a> for physicians using telehealth to treat their patients. This change allows for the use of video chat applications (FaceTime, Skype, etc.) to provide telehealth services.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Office of the Insurance Commissioner OKs the use of non-HIPAA compliant platforms including telephone:</strong> The OIC has <a href="https://www.insurance.wa.gov/sites/default/files/documents/emergency-order-20-02_3.pdf?utm_content=&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_name=&amp;utm_source=govdelivery&amp;utm_term=">issued an order</a> requiring all state-regulated carriers to permit and reimburse for care provided over non-HIPAA compliant platforms – including video chat applications and the telephone.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Governor Inslee's proclamation requires payment parity:</strong> The <a href="https://www.insurance.wa.gov/sites/default/files/documents/emergency-order-20-02_3.pdf?utm_content=&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_name=&amp;utm_source=govdelivery&amp;utm_term=">proclamation implements SB 5385</a> – requiring telemedicine services to be paid for at parity with face-to-face services – immediately.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Medicaid also paying at parity:</strong> Medicaid, including MCOs and FFS, are <a href="https://www.hca.wa.gov/health-care-services-and-supports/hca-supports-increased-telehealth-options-medicaid-clients-public">both paying for telehealth</a> – including services administered over the telephone – at parity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Medicare relaxing telehealth requirements:</strong> The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services has <a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/medicare-telemedicine-health-care-provider-fact-sheet">expanded telehealth services</a> and <a href="https://www.cms.gov/files/document/covid-19-physicians-and-practitioners.pdf" target="_blank">waived certain telemedicine regulations</a> for Medicare beneficiaries during the 2019 Novel Coronavirus pandemic.

Telemedicine allows patients to continue to receive the care they need to manage chronic conditions or minor illness from the safety of their own home. During this public health crisis, allowing patients to receive health care in their homes is safer for the patient as well as the practitioner and their staff.
</p>
<p>
Larger practices and systems currently using telehealth technology are working to scale up those services as demand for COVID-19 testing increases. Smaller and midsized physician practices may want to consider adopting telehealth, which is <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/preparing-communities.html">recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> to help mitigate the impact and prevent the spread of COVID-19. Telehealth can:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Enable people to access care and initial screenings from their home.</li>
    <li>Minimize the demands on in-person primary care offices, urgent care centers, and emergency departments.</li>
    <li>Minimize the use of personal protective equipment like gloves and masks.</li>
    <li>Reduce the risk of exposure to patients and medical care teams.</li>
    <li>Ensure that treatment is available for high-need patients.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Setting up telehealth at your practice</h3>
<p>
The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services has released a comprehensive toolkit for general practitioners that contains links to reliable sources of information on telehealth and telemedicine, which will reduce the amount of time providers spend searching for answers and increase their time with patients. Many of these links will help physicians learn about the general concept of telehealth, choose telemedicine vendors, initiate a telemedicine program, monitor patients remotely, and develop documentation tools. Additionally, the information contained within each toolkit will also outline temporary virtual services that could be used to treat patients during this specific period of time. Download the <a href="https://www.cms.gov/files/document/general-telemedicine-toolkit.pdf" target="_blank">Telehealth Toolkit for General Practitioners</a>. (March 23, 2020)
</p>
<p>
The Health Care Authority has purchased a limited number of licenses for Zoom, a video conferencing technology that can help physicians provide virtual care. The HCA will distribute the licenses free of charge to physicians and providers who have a meaningful need and who don't already have access to telehealth technology, including physicians in smaller practices. Visit <a href="https://www.hca.wa.gov/billers-providers-partners/prior-authorization-claims-and-billing/request-zoom-license-connect">the HCA website to apply</a>. We believe this offer by the HCA is a direct result of our advocacy on behalf of our small practice physicians, and we thank the agency for making these available. (March 20, 2020)

<h3>HIPAA</h3>
<p>
The Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights (OCR) announced that it is relaxing HIPAA rules for health care providers using telehealth in response to COVID-19. This change is effective immediately. According to OCR, the agency "…will waive potential HIPAA penalties for good faith use of telehealth during the nationwide public health emergency due to COVID-19." Under this notice:
</p>
<p>
A covered health care provider that wants to use audio or video communication technology to provide telehealth to patients during the COVID-19 nationwide public health emergency <strong>can use any non-public facing remote communication product that is available to communicate with patients.</strong> This includes Apple FaceTime, Facebook Messenger video chat, Google Hangouts video, or Skype, to provide telehealth without risk that OCR might seek to impose a penalty for noncompliance with the HIPAA Rules related to the good faith provision of telehealth during the COVID-19 nationwide public health emergency.

<h3>Prescribing controlled substances</h3>
<p>
Under the Secretary of Health and Human Services' public health emergency declaration, DEA-registered practitioners may now issue prescriptions for controlled substances to patients for whom they have not conducted an in-person medical evaluation, provided certain conditions are met. <a href="https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/coronavirus.html">Read the DEA announcement.</a> (March 16, 2020)
