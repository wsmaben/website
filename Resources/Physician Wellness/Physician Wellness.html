<p><strong>Together with reducing administrative burden, the WSMA's Healthy Doctors, Healthier Patients initiative provides physicians with programs and resources to help manage burnout and stress in their practices.</strong></p>
<p>
To combat the growing epidemic of physician burnout, the WSMA has embraced the "Quadruple Aim," which builds on the Institute for Healthcare Improvement's Triple Aim of improving the care quality, improving population health and lowering costs by adding a fourth component: Improving the quality of life and work of health care clinicians.
</p>
</div>
<p>
The WSMA has introduced <a href="[@]WSMA/Resources/Administrative_Simplification/Healthy_Doctors__Healthier_Patients/Healthy_Doctors__Healthier_Patients.aspx">Healthy Doctors, Healthier Patients</a>, an initiative campaign aimed at improving physician satisfaction with a strong focus on decreasing administrative burden. Healthy Doctors, Healthier Patients also provides programs and resources to help physicians manage stress and burnout in their practices, many of which you can find on this page.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="[@]WSMA/About/WSMA_Foundation/WSMA_Foundation.aspx">WSMA Foundation for Health Care Improvement</a>, the WSMA's not-for-profit 501(c)(3) organization formed to help improve the health and well-being of all Washingtonians, has also recently added physician wellness as a goal, and will be developing related programs in the near future.

<p>An overview of available resources approaching wellness cultivation from a variety of perspectives.</p>
<h3>Leadership development with the WSMA</h3>
<p>Once out of residency, many physicians will find themselves leading a multidisciplinary team charged with delivering the highest quality care to our patients. To be an effective team leader, core leadership competencies are required—skills not taught in medical school. Without these skills, physicians may find themselves unprepared and overburdened with unexpected responsibilities—a recipe for burnout.</p>
<p>The WSMA is committed to helping physicians develop the skills they need to thrive professionally in today’s health care environment, regardless of the type or size of your organization. Developing core leadership competencies can strengthen clinician resilience, improve time and stress management, and help you achieve greater workflow efficiency.</p>
<p>The WSMA offers year-round leadership development opportunities, including:</p>
<p><a href="[@]WSMA/Events/LDC/Leadership_Development_Conference.aspx">WSMA Leadership Development Conference</a> <br />
This 1 1/2 day annual conference has become one of the premier physician events in the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p><a href="[@]WSMA/Resources/Physician_Leadership/Physician_Leadership_Course/Physician_Leadership_Course.aspx">WSMA Physician Leadership Course</a>  <br />
The WSMA Physician Leadership Course is a dynamic, interactive hybrid-distance learning course that combines in-person and online learning to deliver 40 hours of curriculum over a 10-week period, requiring minimum time away from patient care.</p>

This three-day, in-person educational workshop focuses on leadership development of physicians and their administrative  partners. </p>
<h3>Washington Physicians Health Program</h3>
<p>The Washington Physicians Health Program assists health care professionals with medical conditions that may affect their ability to practice medicine safely. These conditions include substance use and behavioral health disorders, as well as physical and cognitive disorders.</p>
<p>In 2015, WPHP began broadening its scope of services by presenting programs that enhance clinicians’ health by reducing stress and increasing physician satisfaction. WPHP’s new wellness programs include mindfulness and compassion cultivation workshops.</p>

<p>The WSMA established WPHP (known then as the Washington Monitored Treatment Program) in 1986, with both the legislative and financial foundation to function as an independent, nonprofit organization. In 1993, the name was changed to the Washington Physicians Health Program.</p>
<p>Today, WPHP is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization under contract with the Department of Health.</p>

<p>
As most WSMA members are too sadly aware, physicians, who devote their lives to easing others' suffering, die by their own hands <a href="https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/806779-overview#a1">at higher rates</a> than the general population. The WSMA offers the following reminder to its members that physician-focused help and resources are available to them and their colleagues in times of need.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Washington Physicians Health Program</strong><br />
The WSMA encourages members to contact the Washington Physicians Health Program at 800.552.7236 or 206.583.0127 if you or someone you know is in distress and needs personal assistance. All calls are confidential. While participating in the WPHP program, practitioners may continue to practice without being exposed to disciplinary action by their medical staff or state medical board as long as they do not become disruptive or threaten to compromise patient care. Visit <a href="http://www.wphp.org/">www.wphp.org</a> to learn more about the program and its role in helping physicians.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Vital Signs</strong><br />
To help raise greater awareness about the physician suicide epidemic and to provide physicians the tools to attend to their own well-being, the Physicians Foundation has launched <a href="https://physiciansfoundation.org/vitalsigns/">Vital Signs</a>, a new educational campaign. Vital Signs features a webpage to help understand the warning signs to look for in someone who may be suicidal and provides a guide to help start a conversation with a physician about whom a colleague may be concerned. <a href="https://physiciansfoundation.org/vitalsigns/'">Learn more</a>.
