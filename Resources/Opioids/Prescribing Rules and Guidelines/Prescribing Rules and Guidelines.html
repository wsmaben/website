<p><strong>New rules governing opioid prescribing are now in effect for most prescribing professions in Washington state, including physicians and physician assistants, prompted by House Bill 1427 from 2017.

<h2>Washington’s new opioid prescribing rules</h2>
<p>New rules governing opioid prescribing, prompted by House Bill 1427 from 2017, are now in effect in Washington state. The comprehensive rules represent a significant change in how opioids are prescribed. Key provisions applicable to all prescribing physicians and PAs include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A seven-day pill limit for acute prescriptions and 14 days for acute operative pain, with an exemption to these limits when clinical judgment is documented in the medical record.</li>
    <li>A specific care plan and documentation requirements for each phase of pain.</li>
    <li>Mandated registration and targeted checks of the prescription drug monitoring program.</li>
    <li>Required continuing medical education on opioid prescribing.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some differing requirements between Washington Medical Commission and the Board of Osteopathic Medicine and Surgery rulemaking. Prescribing clinicians are advised to review this <a href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/Portals/1/Documents/631073-OverviewHandout-Pharmacy.pdf?ver=2018-10-04-151450-403">Table of Differences</a> from the Department of Health to understand the difference between professions.</p>
