<p><strong>Leveraging data to encourage better prescribing of opioids while protecting patients from highly addictive medications.</strong> </p>
<h2>About the Initiative</h2>
<p>Designed by physicians, Better Prescribing, Better Treatment is a peer-to-peer, non-punitive initiative aimed at ensuring physicians and other prescribers who see Medicaid patients in Washington state are not overprescribing addictive medications while keeping appropriate pain treatments accessible for patients who need them. The initiative was developed in partnership with the Washington State Health Care Authority, the agency responsible for administering the state’s Medicaid program (Apple Health), and the Washington State Hospital Association. Better Prescribing, Better Treatment is a component of <a href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/Portals/1/Documents/1000/140-182-StateOpioidResponsePlan.pdf">the state opioid response plan</a>.
</p>
<p>
Better Prescribing, Better Treatment takes a three-pronged approach to safe prescribing:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Apple Health prescribing policy: The initiative established  a <a href="https://www.hca.wa.gov/billers-providers-partners/programs-and-services/opioids">new opioid prescribing policy</a>  for Washington’s Apple Health program that introduced new pill limits for all opioid prescriptions written for the treatment of acute pain.
    </li>
    <li>Prescriber discretion: The initiative established a non-burdensome process for automated exemption that allows the prescribing clinician&nbsp;to overrule those limits if it’s in the best interest of their&nbsp;patient by simply documenting in the medical record and&nbsp;indicating the exemption on the prescription. Importantly, this approach avoids the additional paperwork and administrative burden that accompany similar policies adopted in other states and that can take time away from patient care.
    </li>
    <li>Physician-led feedback program: The initiative introduced&nbsp;Washington Opioid Reports, a feedback reporting program that  provides data compiled from the state’s prescription monitoring program to physicians and other prescribing providers allowing them to see how their opioid prescribing practices compare to others in their health care system and specialty.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Getting results</h3>
<p>Better Prescribing, Better Treatment's data-driven and data-sharing approach is working. The initiative, now encompassing 17,000+ prescribers at more than 20 health systems and groups in the state, has <a href="[@]Shared_Content/News/Press_Releases/2018/Public-private_safe_prescribing_initiative_results_in_reductions_in_Medicaid_opioid_prescriptions.aspx">reduced opioid prescriptions exceeding the new Apple Health guidelines by nearly 70 percent</a> since its inception in late 2017.</p>
<h3>How to enroll</h3>
<p>If you see Medicaid patients and your organization has yet to enroll to receive Washington Opioid Reports, simply email <a href="mailto:opioidreportsadmin@wsma.org">opioidreportsadmin@wsma.org</a> to enroll. Minimal resources and administrative burden required.</p>
<h3>Expanding statewide&nbsp;</h3>
<p>
Plans are underway to expand Better Prescribing, Better Treatment's data-leveraging strategy to all opioid prescribers in Washington state. We anticipate this expanded statewide opioid feedback program to be available in the first quarter of 2019.</p>
