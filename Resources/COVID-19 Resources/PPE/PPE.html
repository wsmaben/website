<h2>WSMA partners with WSHA to offer masks and gowns</h2>
<p>Many physician practices still face barriers to accessing PPE. The WSMA is partnering with the Washington State Hospital Association, and its subsidiary Washington Hospital Services, to supply procedural masks and level 2 isolation gowns to health care organizations in the state. WSHA has been importing and distributing masks to its membership since April and has a secure relationship with a supplier who is able to offer them bulk pricing. They have agreed to expand the distribution network to include WSMA members, who will now be able to purchase the masks in small quantities, but at the price point of a high-volume order. If you have questions about this initiative, please contact <a href="mailto:ValerieA@wsha.org">ValerieA@wsha.org</a>.</p>
