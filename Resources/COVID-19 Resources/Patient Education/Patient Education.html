<p>The Washington State Department of Health recommends testing anyone with symptoms consistent with COVID-19.</p>
<p>With testing supplies and capacity in Washington increasing, the state is now urging Washingtonians to get tested if they think they might be sick, even if mildly symptomatic (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html">learn more about the symptoms of COVID-19 to watch for</a>). This represents a shift from previous messaging, which urged individuals with mild symptoms to stay home.</p>
<p>Review the DOH's <a href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/NovelCoronavirusOutbreak2020COVID19/TestingforCOVID19">frequently asked questions about testing</a> to learn more about who should be tested, what to do if you test positive, the types of tests (PCR and antibody), and more.</p>
<p>Physicians and other health care providers: If a patient comes to you with concerns over COVID-19 symptoms, state officials are urging you to get them tested. The goal of the state is to have all people with COVID-19 symptoms tested within 24 hours.</p>
<h3>Costs for COVID-19 testing</h3>
<p>
If you have insurance and are symptomatic, there should be no cost to you as a patient for the COVID-19 lab test. Patients who do not have insurance should ask their physician or provider about using the HRSA portal to bill for the test: <a href="https://coviduninsuredclaim.linkhealth.com/">COVID-19 Claims Reimbursement</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Washington State Health Care Authority is working with insurance carriers across all the populations they purchase for, including Medicaid (Apple Health), public employees and school employees, to waive the costs association with COVID-19 testing. <a href="https://www.insurance.wa.gov/health-insurance-and-coronavirus-covid-19-frequently-asked-questions">Learn more on HCA's website</a>.
</p>
<p>
If you don't have health insurance, visit the <a href="http://www.wahealthplanfinder.org/">Washington Health Benefit Exchange</a> to find out if you qualify for free health coverage through Apple Health, Washington's Medicaid program, or if you qualify to purchase individual health insurance under specific circumstances.
