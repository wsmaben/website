<h1 class="mobileShow">Contracting</h1>
<p><strong>Words matter. In medicine, provisions in a contract between a physician and an insurer or an employer glossed over at the time of signing may spring to life in unexpected ways.</strong></p>
<p>The WSMA offers education and information that can help you know what to expect, and to take the right steps to a fair contract that reflects your needs and goals.</p>

<p>Increasingly, physicians are graduating from medical school and transitioning directly into employed positions.</p>
<p>Agreeing to the terms of an employment contract can have profound and long lasting effects on your life.</p>
<p>Contract terms can dictate where you’ll be able to practice, how you’ll be compensated, and what obligations you’ll owe your employer—even after you stop working there. You should never sign a contract without carefully reading its terms, and should consider consulting an experienced attorney to aid you in this review. The WSMA can provide members with referrals to attorneys experienced in employment matters. Email us at <a href="mailto:wsma@wsma.org">wsma@wsma.org</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After consulting a lawyer, however, many physicians decide to negotiate the terms of their contracts on their own. The resources below can help you as you review and prepare to negotiate the terms of your employment contracts.</p>
<p><a href="javascript://[Uploaded files/Resources/Legal/FAQ_noncompetes_20150727.pdf]" target="_blank">Frequently Asked Questions: Noncompete clauses</a> <br />
Employment contracts frequently include noncompete and non-solicitation clauses. While a physician seeking employment will want to avoid signing an unduly restrictive provision, a physician employing other people will want to protect legitimate business interests and the good will of the practice. This concise WSMA FAQ will explain when these clauses are legal and what to consider when you evaluate them.</p>
<p><a href="javascript://[Uploaded files/Resources/Legal/2015-Jan_Reports_Contracts_Physicians.pdf]" target="_blank">Contracts and physicians: The good, the bad &amp; the things to never ignore</a> &nbsp;<br />
Noncompete clauses are frequently part of employment contracts in Washington state. This WSMA Reports (January 2015) article explains important considerations for any physician considering an employment contract, with a particular focus on noncompete clauses.</p>
<p><a href="javascript://[Uploaded files/Resources/Legal/Red_Flags_Physician_Employment_Contracting.pdf]" target="_blank">Red flags in physician employment contracting</a> &nbsp;<br />
Physicians need to be prepared when they negotiate with an employer regarding a job. In particular, physicians must be able, and willing, to identify potential “red flags” during negotiations that might provide insight into the future employment relationship. Read the WSMA’s helpful explanation of the red flags you should be aware of anytime you consider signing an employment contract.</p>
<p><a href="javascript://[Uploaded files/Resources/Legal/Employment_Contract_Checklist.pdf]" target="_blank">Employment contract checklist</a> &nbsp;<br />
A checklist of terms and conditions that are commonly found in employment contracts so that all parties know what terms need to be clarified and agreed to before the agreement is executed. WSMA does not advocate how provisions ought to be written nor espouse a policy position on employment issues.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/life-career/understanding-employment-contracts">AMA annotated model physician-hospital employment contract&nbsp;</a><br />
The American Medical Association has published a valuable resource for physicians who wish to evaluate an employment contract with a hospital. This publication provides a wealth of background information regarding issues which physicians need to consider before even reviewing a proposed hospital employment contract. The document then walks through the terms included in a typical hospital employment contract and provides analysis of important sections and examples of sample language. This is a detailed and comprehensive look at what a physician may expect to see in a hospital employment agreement and should be a “must read” for those entering into employment with a hospital.</p>
